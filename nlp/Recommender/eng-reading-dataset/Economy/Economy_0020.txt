Students quiz big bosses
Many have heard of Warren Buffet’s famous lunches. Guests can ask the billionaire investor any questions about business and philanthropy over a fine meal in a restaurant.Recently, Qi Lin, 23, a finance major from Nanjing University and 19 fellow students had the chance to quiz CEOs over dinner.They asked the CEOs of Bertelsmann China companies about careers and innovative ideas at a French restaurant in Beijing.Qi asked how to deal with obstacles or frustrations at work.Dennis Hu, CEO of avarto Systems China, a global IT full service provider replied: “It’s important to have ownership of your own position. Instead of passively regarding your job as tasks, try to think of it in a more creative way.”Unlike Buffet’s lunches, the 20 students didn’t bid in an auction for places at the meal.The group got their invites by displaying entrepreneurship in the Talents Meets Bertelsmann (TMB) China workshop 2012 to enter the final. They stood out from hundreds of applicants around the country. At dinner they were encouraged to fire questions at the CEOs and produce creative reports based on the information collected during the dinner.They divided into five groups and each team sat at a table with a CEO from one of the companies of the Bertelsmann group, a transnational media corporation.“This gave students the opportunity to have face-to-face, in-depth talks with senior bosses, to share not only their business insights but also their career and life experiences and advice,” said Elyn Hu, a senior HR manager of Bertelsmann China Corporate Center.The students’ questions ranged from how the bosses see themselves in the workplace to even how often they cook for themselves at home. “I was struck by all the odd questions the students raised,” said Hong Kong native Ricky Ng, General Manager from iClick China, a leading online performance marketing provider in Asia.“I realized that students have lively and *unconfined minds. I’m also glad that they seem to put an emphasis on work and life balance,” Ng said.Some students wanted to know how the CEOs started their in-house careers as entrepreneurs from an entry-level position directly after graduation.Kevin Xu, CEO of arvato China, a leading third party outsourcing provider, told them how he once spent several nights working on an electronic version of his company’s invoice to provide a standardized version.He reckoned the most valuable employees were those who are willing to do the basic hands-on work.Career planning upon graduation was another area of students’ interest.Wang Zeyuan, 24, an automation major from Tsinghua University, quizzed Annabelle Long, chief executive of Bertelsmann China Corporate Center.“She advised me to keep all options open before deciding on what I really want to do,” Wang said.“I also learn about the career path in the consulting industry.”Gao Tingfan, 20, a junior economic major from Renmin University asked Long: “When was the last time you cooked for yourself?” He was happy to know that it was just a week ago and this CEO would not put life after work, and he even learnt a tofu recipe from her.Owen Shi, China CEO of Gruner+Jahr Advertising Co Ltd, says that it was a conversation of win-win situation. “The students’ questions made me think in different ways.”Winners will fly to Germany to visit HQThe final of this year’s TMB China workshop, organized by Bertelsmann AG, the transnational media giant, was held from July 11 to 12 in Beijing.A total of 20 participants with an entrepreneurial spirit worked in five groups to present their business proposals to the company’s top executives.This year, Zhu Hongxuan from Peking University, Tang Luqiao from Wuhan University, Zhou Yue from Columbia University and Zhong Mingxuan from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology were the winners. They will fly to Germany to visit Bertelsmann’s headquarters and take part in the “Student Challenge” event in December.
