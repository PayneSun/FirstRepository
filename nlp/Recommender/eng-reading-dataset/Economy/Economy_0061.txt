Rising China sees more top thinkers
When historians look back to the moment when the post-Cold War reign of American power ended, they may well settle on 2010 as a crucial year.Everywhere, it seemed, there were signs that the long-predicted "rise of the rest" had finally occurred, whether in the newfound assertiveness of fast-growing China or the impatient diplomacy of new powers like Brazil and Turkey.Foreign Policy’s second annual list of the Top 100 Global Thinkers fully reflects that new world.As China asserts a growing influence on the international forum, more Chinese candidates find their names on the list, including Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of China’s central bank.Zhou was listed ’for holding the world’s economic fate in his hands.’ Proposing a new international reserve currency to replace the U.S. dollar and resisting pressure on China to appreciate its Yuan, Zhou is a living embodiment of China’s growing clout in the global economy.Apart from Zhou, who moved up the list from the previous No. 9 to No. 4, Editor Hu Shuli (No. 82) with Century Weekly and the most-read blogger Han Han (No. 86) were also listed.In the list, we can see some big shots, including world-renowned investor Warren Buffet and Microsoft founder Bill Gates both topped the list for "stepping up as the world’s states falter."Beginning with Warren Buffett and Bill Gates (1), who teamed up to prove that even in tough times great new ideas can emerge, to the forecasting economist Nouriel Roubini (12), to American president Barack Obama (3) and Angela Merkel (10), The "Iron Lady" of Germany, FP presents more than just their big ideas.
