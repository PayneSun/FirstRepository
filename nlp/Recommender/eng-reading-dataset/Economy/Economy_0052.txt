White collars throw in the towel
Many white-collar professionals are burning out in big cities and moving back home to second-tier cities where the grass is greener and the prospects seem brighter.Cheng Ding is keen to end his "seven-year itch" against the city of Beijing once and for all - by retreating back home to Sichuan Province.Following a failed investment that led to the closure of his own company in Zhongguancun, known as "China’s Silicon Valley," the 32-year-old mobile phone games producer had to relinquish his dream of building a game empire based in the Chinese capital city.For Cheng, the incentive to return home, nearly 2,000 kilometers southeast to Beijing, is more than just financial."Career setbacks are one thing. More important, I’m longing for another kind of life - one with no rush, no rent, no pressure," he says. "Beijing is no longer the home of my dreams."While millions from rural peripheries continue to flood booming metropolises in hopes of better education, better jobs and better lives, a rising group of burnt-out white collars is retreating to the smaller cities in search of a relaxed life style.Most are out-of-town degree-holders around 30 years old, with year-long working experience in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.Cheng’s feelings are pervasive among his peers. More than 80 percent of 7,000 Chinese white collars surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, said "yes" to the question that "would you like to work in a second- or third-tier city if offered a job there?" They were queried in a survey conducted last April by China’s leading online job search website Zhaopin.com.Rising living costs, enormous work pressure, pollution and crowded public transport are the major reasons they want to leave - escalating housing prices top the list, the survey said."Now, we believe some of those who said ’yes’ are taking actions," says Hao Jian, senior human resource consultant at Zhaopin.com.Hao’s conclusion is backed by the website’s survey released last December on the online job applications in six major cities. It showed the number of applications for work in Beijing and Shanghai declining, while increasing in second-tier cities like Chengdu, Wuhan, Chongqing and Nanjing.For example, between October 2009 and October 2010, the number of applicants for Beijing dropped to 12.19 percent from 13.72 percent, while those for Chengdu rose to 3.40 percent from 3.19 percent.Meanwhile, the daily average job offers increased 97 percent to 55,284 in Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan Province, from January to October 2010, while Beijing only saw an increase of 32 percent.Researcher Zhang Zhanxin, with the Institute of Population and Labor Economics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says the figures indicate adjustment in the human resources distribution in top-tier cities and second-tier cities, especially provincial capitals."Though months of observation is still needed before we can conclude there’s a trend of talented people moving to second-tier cities, it’s obvious that signs of a trend have appeared since second-tier cities are becoming increasingly attractive to talents," says Zhang, who studies labor force mobility.He notes the move’s short-term impact on the big cities is "very limited," because "human resources go where capital goes.""For the cities like Beijing, their traditional advantages in education and industries such as high-technology, information and finance, will keep them magnets for investments in the coming five to 10 years," he says.
