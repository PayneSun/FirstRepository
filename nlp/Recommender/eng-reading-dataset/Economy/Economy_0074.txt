China's rich worry their heirs will squander fortunes
According to USA Today, Yuan Qingpeng said the Chinese who have become rich under the economic reform movement in China are worried. They’re worried their spoiled kids won’t know how to hang on to the loot."Their ability to endure hardship and put things into practice is less than the first generation," Yuan says of the children of the rags-to-riches pioneers who have transformed China’s once-moribund business landscape.That’s where his Beijing Business Management Scientific Research Institute comes in.The institute is among several that offer training courses to groom heirs of the super-rich, known here as the "wealthy second generation," in the ways of their class.A January survey of entrepreneurs in wealthy Guangdong Province revealed 62 percent most worried about their heirs’ ability to take over.Cashing in on such fears, entrepreneurs such as Yuan are expanding programs to train the twentysomethings abbreviated here as "Rich2G."Courses are offered by prestigious universities such as Peking and Tsinghua, and private consultancies.China’s rich kids have an image problem in a nation riven by a growing gap between rich and poor. Recent reports on the training of wealthy heirs have excited plenty of critical comments in Chinese media, which last year highlighted the cases of some Rich2G whose love of the fast lane caused deaths by drunken driving in expensive cars."While people like reading or watching TV about the lives of the rich and famous, they look down on people who have made money," says David Goodman, the author of The New Rich in China. The boom in training courses shows that entrepreneurs "are desperate for respectability, desperate ... for people to recognize their social status," he says.In the West, there’s a saying that the first generation builds the business, the second makes it a success, and the third wrecks it, says Briton Alex Newman, a lecturer in international business at a business school. "In China, it’s happening in the second generation," Newman says.But there are also plenty of success stories, he says. "Many of them are very studious, working hard for their family business," Newman says. "Surveys indicate many are reluctant to take over, preferring to start their own companies," something Newman advocates.The male Rich2Gers enjoy at least one consolation: A majority of women prefer to marry a wealthy heir.
