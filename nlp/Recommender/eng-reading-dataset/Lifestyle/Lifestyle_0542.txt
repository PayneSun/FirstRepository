Bad news for couples who work together
It could explain why Richard Burton and Liz Taylor didn’t stay together – and may spell trouble for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Couples who do similar jobs find it harder to maintain a proper work-life balance, a study has found.Researchers looked at the lives of more than 600 academics, about half of whom had significant others working in the same sector.They asked what hours they worked, how strong their boundaries were between work and home life, and how often one sphere affected the other.The team found that those with a so-called ‘work-linked’ partner tended to struggle more to maintain a healthy work-life balance.They also typically worked longer hours.Study leader Professor Gail Kinman, of the University of Bedfordshire, said an ‘increasing number of couples’ have similar occupations – a situation that is ‘particularly common’ in education.She added: ‘The findings suggest that doing similar work to your partner means that work issues are more likely to “spill over” into home life and threaten work-life balance.‘Evidence was also found that having a partner who does similar work can be beneficial, as this can enhance mutual understanding of working conditions and increase support during stressful times.‘Nonetheless, the findings suggest that work-linked couples may need more support to help them set boundaries between work and home.’The study will be presented today at the annual conference for the British Psychological Society’s Division of Occupational Psychology, in Chester.
