Few life-saving devices available
The death of Jin Bo, deputy editor-in-chief of the social networking site Tianya.cn, exposed the lack of emergency resources available in Beijing’s subway system, Beijing News reported.Jin collapsed in the subway on his way home on June 29. Three female passengers conducted *cardiopulmonary *resuscitation, or CPR, and artificial *respiration for Jin. At the same time, subway employees made emergency calls and *dispersed the crowds.But the employees did not have access to an Automated External *Defibrillator (AED), an emergency medical device often kept in public areas in developed countries. An AED delivers an electric shock that can restart the heart. Despite about half an hour of emergency treatment, he was declared dead from a sudden heart attack after being sent by ambulance to a hospital one kilometer away.“If there was an AED in the subway station, Jin’s life may have been saved,” said Jia Dacheng, an emergency room doctor at the Beijing Emergency Rescue Center.The first few minutes after a person’s heart stops beating are critical, he said.According to Beijing News, AEDs are rarely seen in China. Beijing Capital Airport’s second terminal installed AED equipment in 2006, and that was the first public area in China to have an AED. Apart from the airport, only a few subway stations in Shanghai, plus some stadiums in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, have AEDs.About 540,000 people in China suffer a cardiac arrest every year, and less than 1 percent of them are saved – one-third of the rate in the United States, where AEDs are more widely available, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency. In major US cities, the rate is more than 3 percent.Authorities in Beijing will build 50 new emergency rescue stations equipped with AEDs this year, in addition to the current 43, the Beijing Red Cross Society said in April.
