Wardrobe secrets revealed
What do you see when you look into your closet? Heaps of unworn clothing, a wide variety of colors that sing like a rainbow, jeans that don’t fit anymore?Researchers in the field of “wardrobe psychology” believe that hung up in our closets are our emotions, dreams and fears. Read on to find out what your wardrobe says about you.You keep old clothes that don’t fit anymore.Getting rid of your old clothes from yesterday is accepting who you are today, but that’s not something you’re prepared to do. You hang on to the past, clinging to reminders of who you once were, where you’ve been, or what you used to look like, according to New York City-based psychologist Vivian Diller, author of Face It: What Real Women Feel as Their Looks Change.“Hoarding five pairs of pants you may never fit into again can keep you from embarking on new endeavors,” Diller says.Your clothes still have tags on them.If your closet is filled with unworn sale items with the tags still on, you may be trying to fill a void in your personal life with the instant high that comes from spending cash, points out US clinical psychologist Jennifer Baumgartner in her book You Are What You Wear: What Your Clothes Reveal About You. But overloading on sale items you don’t love is “like having five fat-free cookies instead of one of the real thing”, says Baumgartner.There are logos everywhere.If almost everything you own has a logo on it, you may be trying to hide your true identity.“I definitely see women who will only buy stuff if it has the designer logo on it. That’s always a really interesting personality type because there is so much about what you want the world to see and what you don’t want the world to see when you put someone’s name front and center on your body,” Santa Monica-based fashion expert and entrepreneur Tracy DiNunzio in the US told Marie Claire magazine.Your wardrobe is filled with identical clothing.All those identical clothes in your closet may mean you are afraid to change.“Women will often say, ‘It’s because I don’t want to think about it, so that’s why I buy the same thing of everything.’ Yet, whenever I would get the chance to dig a little deeper, I would find that there were these unresolved things around career or relationship. Those are the two main things where there was an impending change or a desire to change but it wasn’t being fulfilled or a risk wasn’t being taken,” says DiNunzio.
