Longest 21st century solar eclipse
A total solar eclipse began its flight on Wednesday across a narrow path of Asia, where it was expected to darken the skies for millions of people for more than six minutes in some places.The longest total solar eclipse of the 21st century will be visible in a roughly 250 km-wide (155 miles) corridor, according to the US space agency NASA, as it travels half the globe and passes through the world’s two most populous nations, India and China.The eclipse began at 5:28 am local time in India and will last up to a maximum of 6 minutes, 39 seconds when it hits the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA.Eclipses allow earth-bound scientists a rare glimpse at the sun’s corona, the gases surrounding the sun.Starting on India’s west coast north of financial capital Mumbai, it took in the ancient Hindu holy city of Varanasi on the Ganges river.Tens of thousands of people snaked through the narrow lanes of Varanasi and gathered for a dip in the Ganges, an act considered to lead to salvation from the cycle of life and death.Amid chanting of Hindu hymns, men, women and children waded into the river with folded hands and prayed to the sun as it emerged in an overcast sky"We have come here because our elders told us this is the best time to improve our after-life," said Bhailal Sharma, a villager from central India, who came to Varanasi with a group of about 100 people.The eclipse was due to sweep through Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and China’s financial hub Shanghai, before heading to the Pacific."In the 21st century this is the longest," said Harish Bhatt, dean at the Bangalore-based Indian Institute of Astrophysics. "This is indeed quite an important event for scientific experiments. Its long duration provides you an opportunity to make very complicated, complex experiments."People in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hangzhou and Lanzhou watched the eclipse and took photos on their mobiles.The total solar eclipse occured in Shanghai at around 9:40, turning the sky dark as night. With so many drivers stopping to observe the eclipse, Shanghai traffic police had to increase the number of temporary parking spaces, according to CCTV. As of 7 A.M., around 500 accidents had been reported.The sky turned black as the moon covered the sun in Wuhan. Street lamps were turned on as the crowd excitedly watched the progress of the eclipse. By around 11:00 the eclipse was visible from the Chushan Islands, Zhejiang Province to the East, the last place from which it could be seen.
