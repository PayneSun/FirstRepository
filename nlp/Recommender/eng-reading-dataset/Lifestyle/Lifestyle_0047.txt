Please mind the silence
Despite being used by 1.34 billion people each year, traveling on the Tube in London can actually be quite lonely. An unwritten rule encouraging silence, mixed with classic British reserve, means that even though you’re packed into an enclosed space with hundreds of other people, the morning *commute can leave you feeling somewhat isolated.One London resident, however, is trying to change this.“You get on the Tube here and it’s completely silent and it’s weird,” says Jonathan Dunne, 42, an American living in London, who has, ironically, started a worldwide dialogue after giving out *badges with the slogan “Tube chat?” last month, encouraging commuters in London to get talking to one another.“I handed out 500 badges during rush hour in a city of 8 million expecting most of them to be thrown away, but after about 24 hours it completely snowballed,” he says.Dunne and his “Tube chat” campaign have since featured in media across the world, seeing TV interviews in Sweden, Brazil and the UK, as well as countless website, newspaper and magazine appearances .Although Dunne says he’s received mostly positive feedback, not everyone agrees with his *sentiment.Londoner Brian Wilson responded with a campaign of his own, handing out 500 badges with the words “Don’t even think about it” on them.“I can’t stand the idea of having to talk to strangers on the Tube on my way to work,” he told the BBC.Michael Robinson, 24, a student from London, agrees. “Being on the Tube is the only peace and quiet some people get on their journeys to and from work. It doesn’t need to be spoiled by people coming up and chatting to you,” he says.While London has its seemingly *antisocial set of regulations to follow, not everywhere lacks a sense of community.In Melbourne, Australia, commuters have set up a private Facebook group used to alert one another when ticket inspectors board the city’s trams. Most Western cities’ *tram stops have no barriers, which means some travelers attempt to ride them without buying tickets.The tongue-in-cheek group comes with a *disclaimer, however: “[The group’s purpose] is to alert fare paying members only which lines their mates – the ticket *wardens – are on so that they can ready their smiles and most importantly, their valid tickets”.Does Dunne hope that some of this community spirit will be mirrored in the UK following his campaign?“People assume that I just walk up and talk to strangers, which I don’t, but it’s been a great way to meet people you would never have normally spoken to,” he says.“On Monday [Oct 10], the *curator of the London Transport Museum had me over for tea.”So if you ever end up using public transport in the West, why not say hello to the person next to you? Just make sure to check for a badge first.
