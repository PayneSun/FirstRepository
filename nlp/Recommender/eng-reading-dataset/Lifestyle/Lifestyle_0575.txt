Tender story of two teens
On Christmas Eve, a girl stands in front of her bedroom window, watching children from the choir come and go. In a window across the street, a boy plays the flute, echoing the choir’s songs.From there, the story of Starry Starry Night begins.Adapted from well-known Taiwanese illustrator Jimmy Liao’s picture book of the same title, it tells of Mei (Xu Jiao), a 13-year-old girl’s beauty and inner pain, through her adventures.Mei is an only child whose stable, middle-class family life is torn apart as her parents careen toward divorce. Luckily she has a doting grandfather who fuels her unwieldy dreams.When grandpa falls ill, all seems lost for Mei – only for a new boy at school, Jay (Eric Lin), to capture her attention. Soon enough the two lonely souls find one another and, looking for a way to escape their real-world troubles, embark on a fantasy-fuelled journey.What director Tom Lin has done great here is balancing the real and the fantastical, with beautifully made computer-generated effects that whisk audiences away on adventures of childish innocence and imagination.He also grounds the drama in a recognizable reality. Mei is forced to deal with the loss of her grandpa as well as her parents’ divorce. Meanwhile Jay struggles to fit in with the other boys at school, and he isn’t up for the physical challenge of being bullied.With each other, however, Mei and Jay find peace and happiness.Starry Starry Night is as much about children coping with family issues, as it is a coming-of-age story for its young protagonists.Mei and Jay are both 13 and there is a fierce hormonal undercurrent also at work here. The summer will not only bring heartache and adventure for these young adolescents, but also their first taste of love.The film comes with a touching epilogue that at first feels unnecessary, but completely sells itself in the film’s final moments. It punctuates the film perfectly and ensures audiences leave with a warm fuzzy feeling burning inside of them.Starry Starry Night is a tender, heartfelt treat about the end of childhood and the loss of innocence and a flight of fancy well worth taking.
