Disclosure of personal data a trend getting out of control
The Chinese identity card looks just like any other: It is the right size, has the right symbols and carries the person’s image and personal details.The only thing unusual about it is the fact that the card has Barack Obama on it.Images of the United States president’s faked Chinese ID card, which was produced by journalists using software readily available for free online, have been circulating the Internet for the last two weeks.If the reporters wanted to make a statement about the huge challenge China faces in combating fraud and personal identity theft, it worked.By using fake IDs, fraudsters will possibly open bank and credit card accounts in other people’s names, leaving victims to pay sky-high bills.Yet, security experts say that the poor protection offered to customers by many Chinese websites means the country’s 400 million-odd netizens - the largest population in the world - actually hand over the exact details these criminals need every time they sign up for a Web service.Research carried out by China Youth Daily shows that almost 90 percent of online users receive spam e-mail and text messages, as well as unsolicited sales calls, after entering their data online.Unfortunately for single people, matchmaking websites are among the worst offenders, say analysts.To log on, users need to provide their name, age, gender, education and employment records, pictures and contact details, and many also give their MSN and QQ instant messenger addresses.Such sites are the "more likely" to disclose customers’ personal data to third parties, said a 2009 information safety report released by Jiangmin Software. It does not state who buys the information.Young Web users, the report added, are largely unaware of the potential dangers of giving out details online.Roughly 95 percent of netizens aged 15 to 30 have signed up with at least one online dating agency, according to China Internet Information Center annual report on Web safety.When freelance writer Deng Hongcheng, 26, signed up with an online dating agency two years ago, he had hoped to find a woman to spend the rest of his life with. What he got was harassed.Shortly after joining, he began to receive calls on his cell phone from sales people early in the morning.His phone continued to ring for two months until he decided to change his number.The most efficient way to solve the problem of personal data disclosure is to make clear laws that carry firm punishments, said Gao Zhiyang, deputy director of China Software Testing Center. Although there are already several articles in at least three laws and regulations, Xie Shoufen, law professor of Fudan University said personal data collection currently relies on industries being self-disciplined.
