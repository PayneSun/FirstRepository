Taiwan travel diary a hit online
"After coming back and thinking over everything I’ve experienced, I realized that it was the people that impressed me the most, far more than any of the beautiful scenes or tasty snacks I could ever consume," Zhao wrote in her online diary.Long-term goalThough only 11 days long, Zhao’s journey in fact started at the young age of 17, when one of her favorite night markets of her hometown of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, was demolished.Disappointed, a bit of searching online helped her discover the Taipei-based Shilin Night Market, a world-famous snack repository. Attracted by its bustling scenes, Zhao started cultivating her goal of someday visiting the market, encouraged by her father, who taught her to always dream big.When she finally made it to Taiwan last year, it was a bittersweet victory, as her father had passed away soon after she developed the initial plan.Zhao then spent seven years preparing for the journey, learning traditional Chinese characters and undertaking deep research into Taiwanese culture.Unexpected generosityShe said she wanted to rely as much as possible on recommendations from locals, so armed with only a map, a travel bag and 30 yuan in cash, she left the Chinese mainland for the first time.Her memories of the subsequent journey revolve almost exclusively around the generous strangers she met.In the airport, she was assisted in exchanging money by a man who even gave her his telephone number in case of emergency. Even the bus drivers were courteous enough to remind her of her stops – and to wake her if she’d fallen asleep on the ride.She was particularly touched by one striking scene from her last day: sitting on the grass at Taipei-based Soochow University with three local students, playing guitar and singing along to the songs of Zhao’s favorite Taiwanese singers."I was so grateful to be living out a scene that seven years ago I’d only been able to imagine," she said. She also admitted to being nervous about how Taiwanese people would react upon hearing that she hailed from the mainland."After I told one of the people who gave me a ride on his motorbike that I was from Beijing, I heard him murmur something. I was instantly gripped by this fear that he was going to say something negative or want to start a fight. But it was totally unfounded – once he dropped me off he even asked if there was anything else he could do to help make my journey better."Indeed, her diary may have a few steps left of its own, as a Taiwanese publishing house has recently published the diary as a book.From Beijing to Taiwan, So Close, So Far Away. Not content to rest on her laurels, Zhao said her final wish is to inspire others to hold onto their own dreams of bridging cultures and making the world a smaller, more friendly place for all.
