Harassed on campus
Sexual harassment on campus used to be a hard-to-define and sensitive topic, but it has gained growing attention in China.The term describes situations where someone makes unwelcome sexual advances toward another person, either with their words or by touch. Sexual harassment is different from sexual assault, which always involves nonconsensual physical contact.The All China Women’s Federation commissioned a survey on sexual harassment, focusing on college students from 15 universities located in major Chinese cities, reported China Women’s News in 2014. The results showed that about 57 percent of female college students have undergone sexual harassment.Wu Changzhen, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told Life Times that flirting, groping and any other contact that makes you uncomfortable counts as sexual harassment.“The deciding factor is whether it’s against your will,” Jiang Mei, vice president of the law department at Hunan Normal University, told Vista magazine. “If a person texts you a flirty message or touches you, and you think it’s OK, then it’s not sexual harassment. Otherwise, it is.”Recent surveys show that some female college students say they would stand up for their rights if they’re sexually harassed. But still, some choose to keep silent, worrying they’ll be alienated if they speak out.
