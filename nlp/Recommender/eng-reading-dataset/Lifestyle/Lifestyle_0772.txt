What will you do this summer?
Summer vacation offers students a blank slate. They can fill it with whatever they want – a trip to the beach, a hike in a park, or a buffet of TV dramas in their bedroom.A survey on Dianping.com recently asked students to vote for their dream summer plans. Over 300 people responded, voting volunteering, taking a cycling trip, doing part-time work, and interning overseas as their top four choices.21st Century talked to four young people who are taking part in one of these four activities. See if their experiences make you want to follow in their footsteps.Volunteer teacherChen Huaxin, 19,Beijing Normal UniversityDestination: Youshan Village, Dafang Town, GuizhouBudget: 1,000 yuanXu Benyu, a volunteer teacher in Guizhou who was honored as one of the “People Who Moved China”, inspired me to become a volunteer teacher in a rural area.I found a program advertised on my university website and applied for a position this past spring. In order to prepare for my post, I attended several primary school classes in Beijing. I also borrowed textbooks and have prepared gifts for my students, including stationery and candy. I even downloaded some videos that I will show my students.I cannot wait to start my journey next week. I know it will definitely be a special experience.Cycling tripLiu Li, 19,Shenzhen UniversityDestination: Xiamen, FujianBudget: 1,000 yuanI see cycling as a great way to enjoy the landscape. I have planned five days of riding that will take me to the coast. I have drawn out my route and bought a tool box.To prepare for the trip, I rode to Huizhou two months ago as a test run. I lost my way several times, my bicycle broke down, and I was exhausted at the end of the trip. I hope everything will go well on this coming trip.I posted my plans on the campus forum in hopes that I would find someone to go with me, but to my disappointment no one dared to try such a tough, long journey.Part-time jobLi Xuemei, 18,Hunan UniversityDestination: Lijiang, YunanBudget: 1,000 yuanPeople: oneMy campus life has been so busy that I wanted to slow down and enjoy some leisure time in a small town. I got the idea from a story named “Soft Time” – about young people spending time in Lijiang. The story included the contact information of a hotel owner.I applied to be a waitress there. The salary for this job is 1,000 yuan a month, including accommodation and food.I will bring my camera to shoot the interesting people and scenery in the small town, and also a laptop to share my life on my blog with friends.Internship abroadCheng Kangping, 20,Zhongnan University of Economics and LawDestination: Bombay, IndiaBudget: 10,000 yuanI got this opportunity through a program launched by Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (AIESEC). I will spend the summer interning at a software company in Bombay.It will be a really big challenge for me, as I have to work and live in a foreign country for nearly two months. I am a little nervous and worried. But I should not treat the trip as a tour because I want to show how smart and hard-working young Chinese people are.
