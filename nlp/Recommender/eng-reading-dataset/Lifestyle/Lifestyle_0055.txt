Don’t worry about a thing
This weekend saw one of the biggest street parties in the world take over London, with crowds of around a million people flooding the streets with a *vibrant sea of music, song and laughter.The Notting Hill Carnival, which took place Aug 28-29, is recognized as the largest street party in Europe, seeing *hordes from across the globe join together every summer to celebrate the many cultures of England’s capital.But in these troubled times – with terrorist attacks, murder and religious tension being almost daily front page fixtures –is it appropriate to be spending the weekend dancing in the streets with wild abandon?“Against adversity, people must stand up for themselves,” says Patrick Bullock, 53, an artist who builds floats for the parade each year.“The smiles and dancing do not stop all weekend – the spirit of the carnival can’t be crushed.”The festival, now in its 50th year, made its debut in 1966, *albeit on a much smaller scale – around 1,000 people attended – and began as a way to encourage unity between the various groups who called London’s Notting Hill their home.Creator Rhaune Laslett, herself half Native-American, half Russian, *formulated the first gathering in 1966, after being inspired by a vision. “I could see the streets thronged with people in brightly colored costumes, they were dancing and following bands and they were happy,” she told the Caribbean Times in 1989.“Men, women, children, black, white, brown, all laughing.”During what was then a period of racial tension, Laslett believed that music and laughter were what was needed to unite the melting pot of nationalities in her west London neighborhood.“We felt that although West Indians, Africans, Irish and many other nationalities all live in a very *congested area, there is very little communication between us,” she explained in an interview in 1966, shortly after the first carnival took place.Over the years, the party grew into its modern day form and now sees the streets swell with the sound of Caribbean steel drums, the aroma of *exotic street food, and the dancing of hundreds of thousands of diverse partygoers in fabulously *flamboyant costumes.“Our participants find themselves in a space of music, color and creativity which brings about the emotion of joy and encourages the freedom to express themselves with no *inhibitions,” says Debora Alleyne De Gazon, the carnival’s creative director.However, not everyone is queuing up to join in the festivities, despite the carnival’s all-inclusive *ethos.“I can’t go out from my door on that day with all the rubbish around,” Fortuoso Cruz, a local resident, tells a London newspaper. “Last year I had to throw some women out who trampled my garden to *wee in there.”But when a million people can come together for one weekend of eating, laughter and music – forgetting about life’s troubles for 48 hours – perhaps a few soiled lawns are a price worth paying.
