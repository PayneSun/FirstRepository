Movable room in a box
Magicians are famous for their use of boxes: from sawing their lovely assistants in half to making themselves disappear. But it may not take a magician or sorcery to furnish a room with just a box. The Casulo is the brainchild of German designers Marcel Krings and Sebastian Muhlhauser. The design duo published the idea in 2007 in their dissertation at the Koln International School of Design in Cologne. Calling it "a new concept for mobile living", they named their design Casulo, the Portuguese word for "cocoon".The Casulo contains everything needed for a bedroom: the bed, a desk, shelves an armoire, and several units of storage. It was designed with the goal easing the more frustrating phases of moving: time, transport and reassembling furniture. The developers promise that no tools are necessary for breaking down or reassembling the Casulo, making it as easy to move in as it is to move out. From inside the box to a fully-furnished room, the job can be done in about seven minutes, as demonstrations show. It can also store all of your bedroom furniture, in a fraction of the space. Moving the Casulo, however, might be at least a two-person job, as each box weighs about 375 pounds(about 140 kg). But manufacturers are aiming to bring the weight down to 330 pounds（about 136 kg）. The Casulo is not yet available in stores, but the team of Krings and Muhlhauser is in talks to get it into production.
