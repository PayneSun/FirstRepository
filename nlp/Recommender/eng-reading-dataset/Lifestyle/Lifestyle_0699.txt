Dare to force job interview?
A survey of 4,500 people co-conducted by sina.com and a leading job recruitment website, Chinahr.com, in November showed that the majority of job-hunters favored forcing themselves on HR personnel for an interview, even if they were rejected at the outset. However, some recruitment experts suggested that grads avoid the "forced interview" tactic because it shows immaturity on the part of the job-hunters and disrespect to the HR personnel with their own work agenda.According to the survey, 74 percent of those polled said they were not opposed to forcing an interview. About 43 percent said they believed they could get a job using the tactic and 51 percent said they are willing to ask for interviews without being informed beforehand.Gaining experienceLiu Zhen, a 25-year-old graduate student with Institute of Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, asked for interviews "forcibly" for at least seven times last year before landing a job at a public institution affiliated with the State Scientific and Technological Commission after being asked to interview."I wanted to get a sense of the interview atmosphere and gain more experiences," Liu said.Huawei Technologies, a leading telecommunication firm, was one of her favorite choices and despite failing the resume selection round, Liu said she went directly to Huawei’s HR staff at their interviewing venue, hoping they could feel her passion for the job. But she was told to return home because they only interviewed selected applicants."If we give you a chance, how can we refuse hundreds of applicants in the same condition as you?" she was asked by the staff.EmbarrassedLiu said she felt extremely embarrassed when she was refused the first time but believed perseverance brings success.She had better luck after forcing an interview with Royal Philips Electronics, and passed the first round successfully, though failed to get an offer after not passing the second interview."A successful forcible interview only earns you an extra chance," Liu said. "It is your performance during the interview that means the most to HR personnel."Liu said the tactic builds toughness.  "You can endure more bitterness and pressure than before because you always beg for a chance and are often refused," Liu said.Don’t be pushyOuyang Hui, a senior employment expert of Chinahr.com, said every company had its own standards for resume selections and HR personnel usually arranged the interview time, venue and the number of interviewees beforehand."Forcing oneself on the HR interviewers disrupts their work schedule and makes their job harder," he said. "Leeching onto the interviewers will even leave a negative impression as someone with an unmanageable personality even if they may be finally recruited due to an excellent interview performance."Ouyang suggested that grads focus on elevating their comprehensive quality and practical interviewing skills instead of forcing interviews.
