Cyber words make language more "geilivable"
Cyber language was popular among Chinese netizens, who created English words to reflect novel phenomenon in society."Geilivable", combining pinyin of Chinese characters Geili (giving strength) with the English suffix for adjectives, literally means "giving power" or "cool". Similarly, "Hengeilivable" means "very cool", and "ungeilivable" means "dull, not cool at all"."Antizen" referred to the group of college graduates who, earning a meager salary and living in small rented apartments, were like the tiny and laborious ants."Smilence" means smile but keep in silence, an attitude people take to comment on an issue which already has drawn consensus."Emotionormal" means "emotionally stable"."Foulsball" showed the anger of netizens towards the woeful Chinese soccer affected by match-fixing, crooked referees, and illegal gambling."Corpspend" was derived from the issue last year. Three college students died in central China’s Hubei Province while saving two drowning children, then fishermen tied the bodies to a boat to ask a high price for their recovery."Suihide" came from the death of a man in a detention center in the southwestern Yunnan Province. Police said he died after playing hide-and-seek with inmates, but this conclusion seemed doubtful.David Tool, a professor with the Beijing International Studies University said it very interesting to combine Chinese with English to create new words. “English is no longer mysterious to the Chinese people. They can use the language in a flexible way according to their own experiences,” he said.Chinese words and expressions were created, as well, by netizens.One example was "Suan Ni Hen". This three-character expression, which originally meant "you win" with the first character carrying the same pronunciation as garlic in Chinese, is used to satirize soaring garlic and food prices this winter.Chinese people use the character "bei" prior to a verb to show a passive voice, and it was used by netizens to show the helplessness in front of false conclusions and fake media reports. For instance, "zisha" means "suicide" while "beizisha" means "be officially presumed to have committed suicide", and "xiaokang" means "fairly comfortable life" while "beixiaokang" means "be said to be living a fairly comfortable life".Wu Zhongmin, a professor at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, saw the phenomenon of word creation as a natural response to young people to social issues."Cyber language is more vivid and it shortens people’s distances," he said.
