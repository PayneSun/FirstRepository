But Simon wasn’t found for 24 hours — even though he was ultimately discovered only about half a kilometer from the family’s campsite. His father Etienne Kruger thinks his son was disoriented when the rain and wind swept in after he got lost.However it happened, Simon wasn’t found for almost a full 24 hours. The overnight weather was cold and wet, dropping to a low of around 43 degrees Fahrenheit.So how did the lost boy survive the cold, wet night?The family said that Simon’s flowers for his mom attracted a kangaroo. His dad explained: “A kangaroo came closer to him and ate the flowers from him, and the kangaroo fell asleep next to him. I think God sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.”
