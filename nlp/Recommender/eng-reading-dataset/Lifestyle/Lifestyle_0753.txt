Museums 'best place to lose wallets'
Researchers found almost half of wallets misplaced at cultural centres were retrieved by their owners.The social experiment, carried out across five British cities, found that a third of wallets dropped in shopping centres were also returned.But not a single wallet dropped in cafés or public transport was handed in.Researchers dropped 100 wallets at various locations in London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Cardiff and Leeds, with each one containing £10 cash, a photograph, receipts, stamps and contact details for their owners.They found one in every five wallets was handed back. People in the British capital the most honest while those from Birmingham the most dishonest.Only one in four “lost” wallets were returned to the West Midlands city but with the money removed. All wallets returned in the capital still contained money.Despite the figures, almost two thirds of more than 2000 people surveyed for the experiment said they would return a found wallet.Figures show nine million wallets, containing an average of £85 and £7000 in credit, were lost or stolen over the past five years.Experts said this equated to careless people losing more than £765 million over that time.They also warned that beyond losing cash, precious personal mementos and the time taken in replacing lost items, people were also exposing themselves to identity fraud.Sarah Blaney, a card Fraud expert from CPP, the insurers, which commissioned the research, said the findings underlined the seriousness of the problem."Losing your wallet or having it stolen is a highly stressful experience and causes great inconvenience and worry,” she said"Card fraud remains a problem in the UK and identity theft is on the rise, so we urge (people) … to take extra care of their belongings.”
