A man's guide to delivering a compliment
Want to insult a woman? Then offer her a compliment.Only half of women actually enjoy being praised and many others misinterpret well-meant words as offensive, according to new research.And "you look well" is one of the worst things a man can say to a woman - because she just thinks it means she looks fat.Other compliments likely to backfire include telling a woman that you like her make-up, or that her dress is figure hugging.Calling a woman "curvy" or saying she looks like her mother or father are also absolute no-nos, according to a survey that will ring true to husbands who decided long ago that paying their wives compliments is more trouble than it’s worth.The social minefield was revealed in a new survey by a health-care company that interviewed more than 2,000 men and women.It found that many women view compliments as "back handed" and are likely to throw them back in your face.The best way to compliment a woman is to mention her weight loss, saying that she looks thinner than normal.Around 43 percent of those surveyed said this was the best compliment.A further four in 10 are happiest when someone comments on their gorgeous smile.Focusing on the way a woman smells, how nice her hair is, or what beautiful eyes she has are also unlikely to be misinterpreted.But men should avoid talking about how well a woman looks as she will think he is saying she is fat.Other backhanded compliments include "you’re not as stupid as you look" and "you don’t look as bad as I thought you would".Women also hate anyone to make reference to their "large features" and are particularly unimpressed if someone says they are strong or broad.More than one in 10 misunderstood praise about their make-up, assuming they were wearing too much.
