Postcard peddler shares travel dreams
Sending postcards back home while traveling abroad is usually merely an afterthought to exploring the sights and sounds of your new destination. For Ou Nanxi, however, it’s a living.Since posting an advertisement on taobao.com, one of China’s major e-commerce platforms, on January 18 pitching the chronicles of her travels abroad – in the form of postcards – to interested buyers for 20 yuan ($3) a pop, Ou, a 25-year-old employee of an Internet company in Haikou, Hainan Province, has scored 147 takers. Setting out over this past Spring Festival holiday to Vietnam, she found herself sharing her travel dreams with people from all over China.Romantic flying dartOu’s story began with nothing more complicated than a desire to see the world and a single flying dart – her preferred method for choosing her destination."Using a dart to choose where I want to go is such a romantic idea," Ou said. "I like the feeling of spontaneity and possibility from being on the road."DedicatedOu’s touch down in Vietnam on January 26 was the first time she’d stepped foot out of China. She said that in the past while traveling around China, she has maintained a habit of sending postcards to herself, but that she’d quickly lose them while moving residences."But I found that my friends always kept the ones I sent to them," she said. "I know they’re more than just pieces of paper – they’re documents of a very special place, time and relationship in your life."Making her way through Vietnam, she made sure to seek out a post office in every city she visited and allotted enough quiet time to compose a kind message to every postcard seeker she was in contact with."Most people asked me to address the postcards to their loved ones," she said.Due to serendipitous timing, most of Ou’s postcards arrived around Valentine’s Day."For girls this was an absolutely priceless present," she said.One man in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province asked Ou to send a postcard to his son, who is still too young to read.Another contact asked Ou to write a letter of appreciation for his wife, with whom the man had recently been arguing, with the words "Thank you for sticking with me through all the hardships without any complaints" on it. This postcard in particular, Ou said, helped her realize the gravity of her task.A valuable pathOu’s travels weren’t without her share of difficulties, though. In 2008 she was diagnosed with Sjgren’s syndrome. Enduring a strong flare-up at one point during the trip, Ou said she was lucky enough to stumble upon a US medical school student, who helped Ou recover through her pain and discomfort and was in turn inspired by Ou’s resolve to seek adventure despite her disability.Ou said her journey was so exciting that she can’t wait to hit the road again."I’m not done selling dreams – I’m thinking about India for my next destination," she said.
