Males turn to cosmetic appearance
It started with just a few cosmetics stolen from his wife, but before long Ben Shiyuan was using facial toners, cleansing milk and moisturizers every morning."And that’s just the tip of the iceberg," said the 39-year-old Beijing executive."I use mud masks and have weekly facial scrubs, and use concealer to hide the dark circles around my eyes and foundation if my skin looks wan."Ben is among the many du shi yu nan - "city jade men", the Chinese term for metrosexuals - who have transformed China into a key market for men’s cosmetics.Sales of men’s health and beauty products in China were set to overtake North America in 2010 and will probably grow about five times faster until 2014, according to consultants Euromonitor International.Sociologists say that confidence has also coincided with a greater desire to impress in the workplace.Data released by consultancy firm CTR suggests almost 40 percent of urban men used skincare products or cosmetics in the first half of 2010, including more than 60 percent of businessmen.Cosmetics also come in handy for job seekers looking to make an impression on prospective employers.Although appearance only accounts for 20 to 30 percent at an interview, "when candidates are extremely similar in terms of capabilities, good looks can become a key factor", said Judy Zhu, a manager at Career International Consulting.Expert cosmetic advice is now offered to city jade men in many lifestyles magazines, including offshoots of popular global fashion publications such as Bazaar Men’s Style published by Trends and Conde Nast’s GQ China.Beauty bestsellersThe men’s skincare market in China was estimated to be worth $269.6 million in 2010, slightly higher than the $227.4 million in North America.L’Oreal SA, the world’s largest cosmetics company, introduced Biotherm Homme to China in 2003, before marketing its popular Men Expert three years later.

The State-owned Shanghai Jahwa United has seen its range of gf products go from strength to strength."Innovation and development has also boosted the Chinese market," said Kevin Zhu at Euromonitor. "It’s gone from simply cleaning and moisturizing products to more sophisticated lines, like anti-aging and anti-oxidation creams."The compound annual growth rate of the entire cosmetics industry soared from $44.83 billion in 2002 to $66.6 billion in 2009, and is expected to hit $77.84 billion by 2012.However, compared to women’s cosmetics in China, the men’s market is still relatively undeveloped, meaning there is lots of room for new products, added analyst Zhu.
