Mammoth search for Santa Claus
Christmas loves a franchise–or any already beloved thing.It can dress up in tinsel and wrap itself around like mistletoe. And then, every year, there are the Christmas specials for almost every sitcom and cartoon, which nod in sincerity (or in irony) towards the holiday season.Since Charles Schultz, the American cartoonist who created Charlie Brown and Snoopy, put his indelible stamp on the holiday with A Charlie Brown Christmas, back in 1965, characters from television and comic books have tried on the Christmas outfit.This year, Fox has tied a bow around its “Ice Age” property for Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas, which premiered on Thanksgiving.The “Ice Age” films, which began in 2002, with a fourth feature slated for 2012, have been successful. One thing many fans would love A Mammoth Christmas is that they can have a chance to spend more time with the memorable characters from the series: Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano), Diego the Smilodon (Denis Leary), and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo).The film tells the story of the birth of the Christmas tree, Santa’s reindeer, his sleigh, his elves and the tradition of mistletoe.It’s also a “Christmas Must Be Saved” story and a “You Must Believe” story.Like the other “Ice Age” films, it involves a dangerous journey and time is found to torture the poor little saber-toothed squirrel, Scrat.Christmas has been strapped on to “Ice Age” like antlers on to a dog–filmmakers behind A Mammoth Christmas may have spent most of their time working on the fourth installment of the “Ice Age” rather than its Christmas special. It feels at times as if someone had merely made a list of things associated with the holiday and threaded a script through them, with little thought to sense or consistency.However, cockeyed Sid, the series’ most likable character, is a high point of the film. In A Mammoth Christmas, he’s still got his silliness, enthusiasm and useful comical shape. Whatever else is happening, Leguizamo and the animators make Sid reliably funny.“It’s wildly irresponsible and impulsive,” he says when Manny’s “little girl” Peaches suggests they go find Santa. “Let’s do it.”
