It’s never too late to find true love
1. Leave the past in the pastWhen you meet someone new, leave any negative feelings or past heartbreaks just where they should be—in the past.2. You won’t meet someone new in your living roomWell, maybe a cute guy will deliver your new sofa, but chances are you’re going to meet someone by getting out there and trying new things—online dating, taking a class, etc. Tell everyone, especially your married friends, that you’re looking to meet someone and ALWAYS go to parties. Because you truly never know who you’ll meet.3. Give the guy a chanceWhen you were 20 your list was “he must be tall, dark and handsome.” Try going against type. It just might be a perfect fit.4. Look at blind dates like a first dateMany women met their husbands on blind dates, and you can too! If you’re not sure you want to sit in a noisy restaurant, go out and do something fun. One of my friends went to a baseball game, and she and her date each brought a friend. They had a blast and got married one year later.5. Time is on your sideTake your time in getting to know your guy and don’t feel in a rush to meet his children or have him meet yours. It starts with the two of you. Make sure this is someone you want in your life.6. Someone to come home toWhen you’re ready to move in together you will discover how wonderful it is to come home to the one you love. Be prepared for some give and take—for example, over which of each others’ belongings stay or go.7. Your wedding, your wayNow you’re in love and it’s time to have your wedding exactly how you want it. Remember it is all about you and the man of your dreams. Whatever you want is the way to go.8. Happily ever after can happen to youIt’s never too late to find true love. We did, and you can too!
