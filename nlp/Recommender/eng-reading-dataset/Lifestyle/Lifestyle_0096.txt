Prince William on How Fatherhood Has Changed Him
Since becoming a dad to the two cutest children on the planet, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, such responsibility has caused Prince William to become a changed man as well. In a new BBC documentary, Kate Middleton’s husband explains the profound effect fatherhood has had on him."I’m a lot more emotional than I used to be, weirdly," the 33-year-old royal tells TV presenters Anthony "Ant" McPartlin and Declan "Dec" Donnelly in a preview of When Ant and Dec Met the Prince: 40 Years of the Prince’s Trust, an upcoming film about the Prince’s Trust, a charity set up by Prince Charles.Now caring for a 2-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter, the prince admits that life has taken on a more serious tone."I never used to get too wound up or worried about things," he continues. "But now the smallest little things, you well up a little more, you get affected by the sort of things that happen around the world or whatever a lot more, I think, as a father."While being a parent has understandably caused Wills to worry more, it’s also taught him to never take for granted the time he gets to spend with his kids or witnessing their major milestones: "[It’s] just because you realize how precious life is and it puts it all in perspective. The idea of not being around to see your children grow up and stuff like that."And the award for Most Adorable Dad of the Year goes to Prince William~
