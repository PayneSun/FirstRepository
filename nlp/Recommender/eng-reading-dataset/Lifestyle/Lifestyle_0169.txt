Generation Z’s new rules
Barrage, geek culture and ACG (animation, comic and game) – behind this *jargon beats the pulse of the newest generation of youths. Born from the mid-1990s to the 2000s, this group is called Generation Z.China Youth Daily has called them the Internet’s *indigenous residents; The Beijing News said their lifestyles seem naturally integrated with technology; and Zhang Xiaoquan, the 1995-born author of “I am Different From This World”, noted outsiders must crack their code of *discourse to gain access to the complexity of their minds. Generation Z is coming to take hold of Chinese campuses, and it is expected to remake the world as we know it with new values, judgments, ways of living and a fresh outlook on the world.Online indigenousAccording to Zhang Baoyi, the head of Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences, the post-1995 generation is hypersocial online. Since their childhood, their social behavior has been molded by online communities where the limitations of space, time and identity are stretched thin.“So the post-1995 generation is very adept at communicating with strangers and making friends to expand their already diverse circle of *acquaintances,” said Zhang. “The drawback is that when caught in a face-to-face communication scenario, they could seem awkward.”Where the post-1980s and post-1990s generations expanded their real-world social connections via the Internet, the reverse is true for the post-1995 generation: real-life connections tend to supplement online friend groups.Young *paradoxZhang Xiaoquan, the post-1995 writer, sees his peers’ double identity as the hallmark of his generation.They can sometimes seem *blunt and wild, but they are also sensitive enough to capture slight emotional fluctuations like, say, in a selfie. “Post 1995-ers” might be the most plugged-in generation, but they’re still capable of being overwhelmed by the loneliness, fear and sense of having missed connections caused by being a single child.“I think that’s the paradox shaping this generation of Chinese who have opened their eyes to a world driven by a rush of technology that brings change to almost everything,” said Zhang, who is now enrolled at the Beijing Film Academy.Promising batchHowever, often described as *capricious, bold and *maverick, the post-1995 generation is reported to be more socially responsible than their predecessors, according to a report conducted by the Ministry of Education on about 7,000 college students born after 1995.“Naturally tech-savvy and Internet literate, the post-1995 generation is more responsible for their online behavior and expression than post-1980s,” survey project administrator Wei Jinping told China Education Daily.With various tags already attached to post 1995-ers, the rising of a new generation is bound to bring more surprises.
