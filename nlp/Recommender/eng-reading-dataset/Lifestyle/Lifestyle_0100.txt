Reforming ‘hukou’
Suppose your permanent residence, or hukou, was in Chongqing, you worked in Beijing and you needed to get a passport for a business trip abroad. What should you do?You have to go back to Chongqing, which is 1,500km away, and apply to local public security authorities for the passport, because, in China, public services are closely linked to hukou. But a new regulation, which is part of the hukou reform, will make this annoying experience a thing of the past.The regulation targets China’s newly introduced residence permit system, which will take effect on Jan 1, 2016. It allows people who don’t have local hukou to receive more access to basic public services in the cities where they are living. These include education, basic employment services, automobile registration, and passport and ID card application processing.You can apply for a residence permit at the local police station, which has jurisdiction over the area where you live. The documents needed for the permit application include your ID card, photos and materials that prove that you have a job, a place to live, or that you are studying at an education institution.To certify that you have a place to live, a house rental contract or property ownership certificate will do. For employment, a business license, job contract, or employment certificate can do the trick. If you are a student applying for the permit, show your student card or other documentation issued by your school.Despite all this, maybe you are still not happy about not having a local hukou. Don’t worry. People will have a chance, as the country is reforming the hukou system further.China plans to create a new hukou system by 2020, based on a person’s place of residence and job. But different cities will have different policies. Big cities like Beijing will put in place more, stricter requirements, while getting a hukou in medium or small cities will be much easier, says the regulation.
