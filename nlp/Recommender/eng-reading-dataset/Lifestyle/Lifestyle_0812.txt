New York beefs up security
Two female suicide bombers attacked Moscow metro stations during the Monday morning rush hour. Both likely had links to the North Caucasus, the centre of an Islamist insurgency against Moscow, the head of Russia’s FSB state security service said.Some Russian officials have said that the insurgents in the North Caucasus, which includes Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan, have ties to al Qaeda, though many analysts have disputed the link.Lavrov did not mention al Qaeda, but said the bombers may have had links to militants on the Afghan-Pakistan border, where al Qaeda militants, and Afghan and Pakistan Taliban fighters are present.Asked if there could have been any foreign involvement in Monday’s attacks, Interfax quoted Lavrov as saying: "I do not exclude that.""We all know that the Afghan-Pakistan border, in the so called no-man’s land, the terrorist underground is very well entrenched," Lavrov was quoted as saying.  "We know that many people there actively plot attacks, not just in Afghanistan, but also in other countries. Sometimes the trails lead to the Caucasus," he said.New York City stepped up security as a precaution Monday following the suicide bombings in Moscow’s subway system, sending more police into rail and subway stations.According to local media reports, police were allowed to conduct random inspections of rail yards when necessary.Police vehicles were dispatched to the city’s transit hubs, and officers assigned to subways overnight were held in place so they overlapped with the day tour. Special units distinguished by their special black uniforms, helmets and body armor also were assigned to transit facilities, according to reports.The New York Police Department (NYPD) issued a statement Monday morning saying it was increasing coverage of the city’s subway system as a precaution "in response to the Moscow bombings.""In response to the Moscow bombings, the NYPD is increasing police coverage of the New York city subway system," NYPD spokesman Lieutenant John Grimpel said, adding there was no specific threat against New York and that the measures were a " precaution."The city’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) acknowledged heightened security, but declined to provide details. The agency is in charge of the city’s buses and subways, as well as suburban trains, and bridges and tunnels.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city "did ramp up our coverage a little bit this morning" after officials warned of the Moscow bombings.
