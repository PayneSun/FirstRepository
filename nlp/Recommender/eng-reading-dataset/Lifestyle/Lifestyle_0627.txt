Humanity will encounter alien civilisations with the next two decades, a top Russian astronomer predicted on Monday.Professor Andrei Finkelstein, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Applied Astronomy Institute, said that ten percent of the known planets circling suns in the galaxy resemble Earth, and if water can be found on them, then so can life.He was speaking in Moscow at an international forum dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life.’The genesis of life is as inevitable as the formation of atoms... Life exists on other planets and we will find it within 20 years,’ said Professor Finkelstein.As to the all-important question of how aliens will look, he added they would most likely resemble humans with two arms, two legs and a head.He said: ’They may have different colour skin, but even we have that.’Professor Finkelstein’s institute runs a programme launched in the 1960s at the height of the Cold War space race to watch for and beam out radio signals to outer space.’The whole time we have been searching for extraterrestrial civilisations, we have mainly been waiting for messages from space and not the other way,’ he said.Professor Finkelstein’s comments came on the same day a video emerged purporting to show ’a mothership and its fleet’ zipping around in the clouds above a BBC building in central London.
