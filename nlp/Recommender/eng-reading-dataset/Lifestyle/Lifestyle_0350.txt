Our eating habits are causing a global crisis
Zhou Jinsong, a canteen manager at Central South University, said that students produce over 12 barrels of leftovers on a daily basis — each barrel stands at one meter in height. Zhou’s canteen is just one of several on the campus.But canteen waste is merely the tip of the iceberg. According to Xinhua News Agency, the food wasted by Chinese people equates to about 50 million tons of grain every year, or 10 percent of the country’s total annual grain production.This dumped food could feed another 200 million people. If that wasn’t bad enough already, numbers around the world are even uglier.Food waste, which has become a global issue, serves as a mirror that reflects various cultural and societal issues in different countries.In the West, for instance, consumerism, the belief that it’s good to use a lot of goods and services, is often to blame for food waste. China, in turn, features its own eating culture and a generation of single children that is less aware of the food waste issue.New generationQuantifying how much food college students, most of them single children, waste is a shocking exercise.As a 2011 survey conducted by China Agricultural University shows, 28.3 percent of canteen food ends up in rubbish bins on campuses nationwide, over twice the national average (10 percent).“What students waste every year could feed over 10 million people,” Zheng Chuguang, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, told China Education Daily.Gong Tao from the Youth League at Central South University, has seen a diminishing awareness of food waste on campus over the years.“Students nowadays are well protected by their families and hardly have any concept of how much toil others go through in order to provide them with the food they eat,” he said.Face countsAccording to Yu Changjiang, a sociologist at Peking University, the communal dining tradition and the social function of banquets make food waste almost inevitable in China.“Since the 1980s, when Chinese gradually became more affluent, food waste has been a subject of debate. But things have hardly changed over the years,” said Yu. “It’s the Chinese way of showing respect to guests and displaying generosity, often referred as mianzi.”But rather than tradition, huge public spending on government banquets is also fuelling food waste, said Zhou Xiaozheng from the sociology department at Renmin University of China.“It’s the result of widespread reception meals at government levels,” he told Economic Daily.Extravagant government banquets at the taxpayer’s expense have become “a major source of waste, a degrading factor of social morality and political atmosphere”, commented People’s Daily last week.China Daily added: “It is also important that everyone thinks about how they can do their bit to reduce food waste.”
