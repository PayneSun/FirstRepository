1/4 female job seekers experience sex discrimination
Sex-based discrimination in workplace is widespread in China as one in four female job seekers is denied of employment because of their gender, a study has found.The research, released by the Center for Women’s Law and Legal Services of Peking University, polled 3,000 women over one year’s time and came up with the result after data analysis and in-person interviews, the China Youth Daily reported Sunday.According to the report, one in 25 of the surveyed are forced to sign labor contracts that contain clauses forbidding them to get married or pregnant in a set period of time.More than 20 percent say employers cut salaries on women who become pregnant or give birth, and 11.2 percent lose their jobs for having a baby.According to law, Chinese women may take a maternity leave for at least 90 days, while their American peers have just seven days off.Some 28 percent say employers set different criteria in recruitment and women have to perform much better than their male peers in interviews to get the same job.More than one third believe male employees have more opportunities than women in getting promoted, and 52.1 percent attribute to it the fact that women have to spend more time taking care of children and family chores.The research also found one in 20 women experienced workplace sexual harassment."The society needs to foster the idea of gender equality in employment," said Guo Jianmei, director of the center. "But legislation is the most effective way to wipe out discrimination from workplaces."
