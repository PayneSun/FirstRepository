A pet's commandments
A dog is our friend, who will never oppose and hurt us. No matter who you are, wealthy or poor,they will always be with you. Now, please read these pet’s commandments, which will help you get a better understanding of your faithful friend.My life is likely to last ten to fifteen years. Any separation from you will be painful for me. Remember that before you buy me.Give me time to understand what you want of me.Don’t be angry for me for long and don’t lock me up as punishment. You have your work，your entertainment and your friends. I have only you.Talk to me sometimes. Even if I don’t understand your words, I understand your voice when it’s speaking to me.Be aware that however you treat me, I’ll never forget it and if it’s cruel it may affect me forever.Remerber before you hit me that I have teeth that could easily crush the bones of your hand，but that I choose not to bite you.Before you scold me for being lazy or uncooperative, ask yourself if something might be bothering me. Perhaps I’m not getting the right food, I have been in the sun too long, or my heart might be getting old or weak. Take care of me when I get old. You too，will grow old.When I will leave, you must guard at my side. Never say “I can’t bear to watch it” or “let it happen in my absence”. Everything is easy for me if you are there. Remember，I love you.
