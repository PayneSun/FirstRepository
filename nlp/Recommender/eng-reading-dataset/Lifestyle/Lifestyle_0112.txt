A toast to Downton
It’s a sad week for Downton Abbey fans as the English period drama aired its final episode on Nov 9.Six seasons after it debuted on ITV in 2010, Downton Abbey has attracted fans worldwide with its vivid depiction of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants trying to adapt to changing norms in the early 20th century.The first episode starts with Lord Grantham losing his heir in the sinking of the Titanic. Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), a distant cousin, is proclaimed the new heir and falls in love with Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), the eldest daughter of Earl of Grantham.“It’s a surprise to realize how important her [Lady Mary’s] romance was to the success of the series. Her often scandalous love life, belying her chilly exterior, kept us hooked,” commented Daily Mail.But that isn’t the only virtue of Downton Abbey. For fans across the globe, its portrayal of uptight aristocratic life makes it stand out.The story happens in the post-Edwardian era, when social etiquette was held in great regard. There were strict rules for what to wear on certain occasions, how to set a dining room table and even what to eat first.These rules may have disappeared over the years, but the drama inside Downton Abbey remains timeless. People are just as anxious about status and family obligation nowadays as they were decades ago, said Anne Mattina, a university professor from Boston, in an article for The Huffington Post.Downton Abbey also sheds light on the traditional British social hierarchy–the upstairs and the downstairs – according to Alison Graham, a British television critic.“Downton Abbey was immaculate, a tidy, self-contained world where everyone knows their place,” she wrote on Radio Times. Though it’s a rather gentle paint of the cruel English social history, it sets “a touchstone for an idea of Britishness”, she commented.The Daily Mail agrees on that matter. “Downton Abbey set a new standard, and it’s probable that in 20 or 50 years critics will look back and say that this was period drama at its very best, often imitated but never bettered,” the newspaper commented.
