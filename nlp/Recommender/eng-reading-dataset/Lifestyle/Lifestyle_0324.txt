Why being blonde might not be so fun after all
Gentlemen no longer prefer blondes - with most believing brunettes make better wives and girlfriends, research has revealed.A study found that men see women with dark hair as "deeper" and "more sensible" than their blonde counterparts.It also emerged that men think brunettes take better care of their appearance, make better cooks and are more proficient at keeping the house clean.Other "wife-like" attributes men think brunettes are likely to possess include being more experimental in the bedroom and being better with money."Men obviously have their opinions about the colour of women’s hair," said a spokesperson for Superdrug, who conducted the research."But our sales tell us that when it comes to hair dye women are more likely to change their shade when they see a celebrity switch shade than any other reason."This research turns our hair stereotypes on their heads."The study of 1,000 men showed 54 percent would choose a brunette to be their wife, 16 percent would opt for a lady with fair hair, while 30 percent don’t have a preference.And when it comes to getting a girlfriend, 48 percent chose girls with brown hair, one in four chose blonde and 27 percent said neither.
