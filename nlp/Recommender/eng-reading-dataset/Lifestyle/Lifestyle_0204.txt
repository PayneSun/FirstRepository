Diaosi find struggle everywhere
Though other countries may not have a word that holds as much meaning as what diaosi does in China, they do have young adults that are struggling not only to get ahead, but just to get by.Graduates throughout the world are discovering that in today’s post-recession economy, a college degree isn’t the game changer it once was. Many graduates are either unemployed or underemployed, and according to projections from the International Labor Organization, this trend will have dire repercussions.“The economic and social costs of unemployment, long-term unemployment, discouragement and widespread low-quality jobs for young people continue to rise and undermine economies’ growth potential,” the report says.The organization also warns that poor employment prospects are already sparking movements of unrest among young people across the globe and causing them to lose faith in the current socioeconomic and political systems.In this package, we look at how diaosi in foreign countries are dealing with the pressures of being young, unemployed and without the means to better their lives.EU: Stranded in the nestWith a bachelor’s degree in translation and half of a decade’s worth of professional experience under her belt, 28-year-old Paloma Fernandez still can’t find a job.“Sometimes you feel like yelling: ‘I want a job, I want to have a routine!’ We always complain about routines but when you don’t have it, you miss it,” Fernandez told AFP.Fernandez’s situation isn’t unique. The European Union’s youth unemployment rate stands at 19 percent, while in Spain, where Fernandez is from, a startling 55 percent of young adults are unemployed.Those Spanish youth who do secure employment rarely find the sort of job that would enable them to climb up the economic ladder.“Safe, permanent positions with benefits and decent pay – the kind of job that would allow you to buy a house and start a family – seem as rare as snow in a Seville summer,” wrote Tobias Buck in the Financial Times.Like youth in countries on both sides of the Atlantic, Spain’s struggling young adults are finding themselves stranded in the nest.“The share of young Spaniards below the age of 30 living with their parents now stands at close to 50 percent,” wrote Buck. “Many are living off handouts from their parents, reduced to asking for what is essentially pocket money.”
