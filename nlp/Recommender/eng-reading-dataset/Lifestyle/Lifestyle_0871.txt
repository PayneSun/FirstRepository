Is this the Loch Ness monster?
One Internet fan claims he found the legendary Loch Ness monster in satellite images on the virtual globe, Daily Mail reported.Security guard Jason Cooke said the 65ft oblong shape followed by thin strands is actually the highly contested creature supposed to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands.Jason told the Sun: ’I couldn’t believe it. It’s just like the descriptions of Nessie.’Nessie enthusiasts believe the creature is a plesiosaur - an aquatic reptile that appeared at the start of the Jurassic period and is widely believed to be extinct.Some claimed a series of vertebrae uncovered on the shores of Loch Ness were ’proof’ that there was a living plesiosaur in the Loch. Adrian Shine, a researcher on the Loch Ness project, called the new images ’really intriguing’ and said they deserved further study.The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to the world’s attention in 1933.Scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern-day myth and continued sightings as set ups and wishful thinking.Yet it has remained a contested phenomenon for almost 80 years.The latest tantalising sighting can be seen on Google Earth using the co-ordinates Latitude 57°12’52.13"N, Longitude 4°34’14.16"W.
