Take art slow, steady
In the best-selling novel The Goldfinch by US writer Donna Tartt, protagonist Theo developed a special relationship with a small oil painting of a chained goldfinch created by Dutch master Carel Fabritius. The painting touches him, transfixes him, dredges up memories of the past, and even seems to be communicating with him whenever he looks at it. Of course, not all of us art lovers can have a famous painting in our private possession like Theo does, but when we go to a museum, how many of us truly spend time marveling at pieces of art?The typical museumgoer grabs a map and spends the next two or three hours tracking down each exhibit’s highlights. They dart from one masterpiece to the next, battling the crowd for a better view, maybe taking a selfie or two, and then checking the item off their bucket list.But once they’ve left the museum, can they really say much about the artwork they’ve seen? Do they have any lasting impressions?Look deepA recent New York Times article suggest we slow down and truly spend time appreciating artwork that draws us in, not analyzing so-called masterpieces just for the sake of appearances.According to museum researchers, the article says, the average museumgoer spends only 15 to 30 seconds in front of a work of art.The New York Times interviewed James O. Pawelski, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies connections between psychology and the arts.When you go to the library, you don’t walk along the shelves looking at the spines of the books and on your way out tweet to your friends, ‘I read 100 books today!’, Pawelski said.Yet that’s exactly how many of us experience museums. “They see as much of art as you see spines on books,” said Pawelski. “You can’t really see a painting as you’re walking by it.”Pawelski said that if you do choose to slow down — to find a piece of art that speaks to you and observe it for minutes rather than seconds — you are more likely to connect with the art, and maybe even with yourself.
