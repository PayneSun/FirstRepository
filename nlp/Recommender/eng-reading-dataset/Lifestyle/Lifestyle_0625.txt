'Mother-in-law from hell' contradicted by real mother-in-law
A bride-to-be condemned as “uncouth” and “vulgar” by her fiancé’s stepmother enjoyed a welcome vote of support – from her real future mother-in-law.Heidi Withers was berated as graceless and unladylike in a vitriolic email from Carolyn Bourne, the stepmother of her future husband Freddie Bourne, a businessman.The message became an internet sensation after being rapidly circulated online, earning Mrs Bourne the nicknames “Miss Fancy Pants” and the “mother-in-law from hell”.But Mr Bourne’s real mother, Penelope Godfrey, rode to Miss Withers’ defence, describing her in glowing terms as a “charming girl” with impeccable manners.She pointedly dismissed Mrs Bourne’s depiction of her future daughter-in-law as opening a “can of worms”.Speaking outside her home in Putney, west London, she said: “The whole thing has opened a can of worms that really should not have been opened.“I love both my son and Heidi is a charming girl who I have never found rude – not once.”“She is also Freddie’s choice and will always be welcome in my home.”Following a stinging rebuttal to Mrs Bourne from Miss Withers’s father, Mrs Godfrey laughed that the wedding would be “awkward”, remarking: “We shall see.”But asked for her thoughts on her ex-husband’s new wife, she stopped laughing, adding: “absolutely no comment.”The couple, who are due to marry at the 12th Century Berkeley castle in Gloucestershire in October, put on a show of unity, walking hand in hand outside their flat in Fulham, west London. Smiling as they strode down the road, accompanied by their shih tzu lapdog, Whisky, Miss Withers wore a prominent engagement ring on her left hand.Friends and family also rallied around Miss Withers, 29, a PA from a West End recruitment firm.Susan Kent, the mother of one of Miss Withers’s friends, wrote to the letters page of The Daily Telegraph, describing her as a “delightful” house guest.A source close to the family said: “The wedding is still definitely on. They are a bit shocked and embarrassed by the whole episode but their commitment to each other is stronger than one email.“Hopefully it’s something that the whole family can laugh about in years to come.”
