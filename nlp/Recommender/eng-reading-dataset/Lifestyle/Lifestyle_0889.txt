China's Filtering Software Contains Pirated Code
The "Green Dam" filtering software that the Chinese government is reportedly requiring for all PCs sold there contains pirated code, a U.S. software manufacturer claimed on June 12.Solid Oak Software, the developer of CyberSitter, claims that the look and feel of the GUI used by Green Dam mimics the style of CyberSitter.According to a study by the University of Michigan, the software uses blacklists compiled by CyberSitter, dating back to 2006. An encrypted news bulletin, which dates back to 2004, was also accidentally included.Solid Oak’s Milburn said that he had received an anonymous email alerting the company that Green Dam was using Solid Oak code."From the stuff they’ve posted, I’m 100 percent certain they’re using our proprietary code," Milburn said, "We’re still trying to do the detective work here."According to Milburn, the company spent Friday trying to determine what its options were, and what avenues it could pursue to try and prevent its code from being misused. "We haven’t had any opportunity to explore our options," Milburn said. "At the very minimum, I believe we would pursue some sort of injunction."This isn’t the first time Solid Oak’s code has been stolen, Milburn said. In the late 1990s, hackers reverse-engineered CyberSitter, which prevents underage children from accessing pornography or other adult content, to allow users to access such content.The hackers, as well as other detractors, have previously accused Solid Oak and CyberSitter of censoring the Internet. "That’s why we don’t want to be associated with it," Milburn said of Green Dam.Moreover, potentially millions of Chinese PC users could hit Solid Oak’s servers for updates, causing them huge fees for the additional bandwidth costs the company would be charged for.One obvious solution to the problem would be to block access to China, a move that would also cut off a number of American schools in China, that use the software as a legitimate means of preventing children from accessing the adult content. Some organizations with satellite offices in Singapore, Korea, or other South Asian countries might also be affected."They’re using it legitimately, and we don’t want to turn off the entire continent," Milburn said.
