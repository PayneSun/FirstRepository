China's new media in 2010
Going far beyond human beings’ traditional notions, new media has been growing fast and influencing people’s lives in ways few things have done before.In 2010, China’s new media industry witnessed explosive development. But with "new" comes uncertainties and challenges. The following are brief reviews on the development of China’s new media and outlooks on its future.MICRO-BLOGGINGAt a time when netizens lost interest in lengthy articles and elites seek to always be in the spotlight, micro-blogs make their wishes come true.Short and convenient, micro-blogs also experienced a "big bang" in China last year, with the number of micro-bloggers at China’s popular portal sina.com.cn almost doubling in less than six months.Afterwards, the other three major web portals, including sohu.com, qq.com and 163.com, each set up their own micro-blogging services.With more government officials and entities registering, China’s micro-blogging services are widely expected to play a more important role in connecting the public and the governments in 2011.SEARCH ENGINESBaidu’s dominant position in the search engine market would face fierce challenges from rivals, including sohu.com, Microsoft’s Bing and goso.cn from the People’s Daily.Xinhua is also preparing to launch its joint venture search engine, together with China Mobile, a leading company in mobile networks.Goso and Xinhua both have the advantage in term of providing content, while Bing has a big edge in technology and funds. They are expected to post imminent or potential threats to Baidu in 2011.INTERNET OF THINGSIoT refers to a network of real-world objects linked by the Internet and interacting through on-line services.With the IoT listed as one of the "emerging strategic industries" in 2009, China set up its first IoT research center in Shanghai in March 2010.Within the same week, Premier Wen Jiabao stated in the annual government report that it would "accelerate the research and development, as well as application of the Internet of Things."However, some experts have said that China’s IoT was still in a very early stage, and it will take a long time for it to achieve large-scale development in order to let the public enjoy its full functions.
