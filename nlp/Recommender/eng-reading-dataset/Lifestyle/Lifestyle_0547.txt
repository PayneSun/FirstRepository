White-collar hazards
The untimely death of a young office worker in Beijing has put the spotlight on the health risks associated with the lifestyles of white-collar workers.Fang Yan, 23, an employee of Datang Mobile in Beijing, died after an acute stomach ulcer hemorrhaged on December 16. From several micro blog posts, the link between her degrading health and long working hours is hard to ignore.“Washing my hair before going to bed gives me a migraine. Eating after 9 o’clock at night makes my stomach bleed. I am only 23, but I’m plagued by all sorts of physical defects already,” wrote Fang 48 hours before her death.Her tragic death has fueled the debate about stressful lifestyles. Though China’s economy and living standards have improved significantly over the last decade, premature deaths resulting from unhealthy lifestyles are also on the rise.According to Ciming Checkup Group, up to 76 percent of the white collar workers suffer from “sub-health”. Nearly 60 percent were found to be stressed, while less than 3 percent have a perfect bill of health.The number of female white-collar workers who die as a result of cardiovascular disease is now twice the number of those who die of cancer.The report is based on the health checkup results of 3 million white-collar workers in more than 10 major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.It suggests that, due to an increasing lack of exercise, diseases such as diabetes are becoming more prevalent among a younger age group.Health experts believe that university students and white-collar workers are particularly susceptible to risky lifestyles and few realize how permanent damage can be.Jiang Zhuoqin, Dean of the Department of Nutrition in the School of Public Health at Sun Yat-sen University says: “Some young people suffer poor diet, often neglect exercise and stay out late at night. Others become addicted to drink and cigarettes.”As health experts point out, most bad habits are deep-rooted and can be traced back to the struggles of college entrance examinations when most adopt a highly sedentary routine with irregular meals.For many college recruits, newfound freedom ushers in an unrestricted and often harmful lifestyle. “Being a distance from parents’ care and suddenly gaining more free time, students seldom learn to regulate their daily schedule,” says Jiang.Zhou Shiyuan, 18, sophomore majoring in landscape gardening in Beijing Forestry University says that often he will spend a whole night in front of a computer screen.“It gives me a chronic headache and a stomach ache for missing breakfast,” Zhou says.Stress also plays a large role in diminishing health. Major sources of stress for youngsters include academic requirements, job-hunting and parental expectations.“These factors can cause a negative mental state,” he says.
