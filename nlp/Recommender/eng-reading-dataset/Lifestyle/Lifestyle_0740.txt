Less than 1% of men who are having an affair said they would be prepared to go without nights with their mistress in order to save money, according to an extra-marital dating website in UK.Instead, 16% said they would go without a new car, 15% would put off extending their home and the same proportion would sacrifice their football season ticket.A further 11% would cancel their gym membership, while 10% would put off upgrading their mobile phone and 6% would go without a holiday rather than stop seeing their mistress.Four times as many men would also stop taking their wife on nights out in order to save cash as those who would cut back on socialising with their mistress.Sara Hartley, of IllicitEncounters.com, which produced the survey, said: "Weâ€™ve seen through extensive research that men who cheat have a great deal in common, psychologically, with men who gamble. "For many monetary risk-takers, starting an affair may be another way of satisfying their urges without breaking the bank."
