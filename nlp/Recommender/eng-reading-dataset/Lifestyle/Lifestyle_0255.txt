The teenage boy addicted to taking selfies
When Danny Bowman was at school, he was so desperate to attract girls, he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image.But his addiction, which began at the age of 15, caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight.He would take 10 photos of himself before he washed and would sneak out of class three times every hour. At 16, he dropped out of school so he could focus on his addiction, and his diet began to deteriorate.He did not leave his house in Newcastle upon Tyne for six months, and when he failed to take the flawless shot, he tried to kill himself by taking an overdose.His mother, Penny, managed to save him, but he was forced to seek help after his addiction had spiralled out of control.The 19-year-old believed to be Britain’s first selfie addict, has now had therapy to treat his technology addiction, OCD and Body dysmorphic disorder – an excessive anxiety about personal appearance.He has not taken a picture of himself in seven months, and has realised that achieving perfection is impossible.He told the Sunday Mirror: ’I was constantly in search of taking the perfect selfie and when I realised I couldn’t I wanted to die. I lost my friends, my education, my health and almost my life.’The only thing I cared about was having my phone with me so I could satisfy the urge to capture a picture of myself at any time of the day.’He would look at photos of his ’idol’ Leonardo Di Caprio and would then replicate his poses. Danny’s dream was to become a male model.The selfie craze has grown in past five years, with stars, ­politicians and even Pope Francis posting getting involved in the sensation.But one psychologist at a clinic where Danny was treated said the addiction with taking selfies has now become a mental illness.Now determined to raise awareness of the anxiety disorder, Danny is working with Fixers – a national charity helping young people ‘to ‘fix’ the issues that matter to them.He said their help has kept him alive and called on others to seek help before they end up in hospital.
