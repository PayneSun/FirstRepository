Moustache for cash
If you’re planning on visiting a country in the West this month, you may notice something unusual when walking the streets. That’s because November is the time when thousands of men choose to put down their *razors and let their top lips grow wild for four weeks.“Movember”, as the annual event is known, sees men in countries including the UK, US and Australia grow out their facial hair while collecting *sponsorship money from friends, family and colleagues, with the money going to cancer charities and other worthy causes.But what motivates people to take part?“Movember is my middle finger to cancer,” says Andrew Hahn, a resident of Santa Monica, California, US, who’s raised over $100,000 (677,390 yuan) for the cause since he started taking part six years ago.“As a father, I’m terrified of cancer and of not being here for my son as he grows up. The most logical part of my mind participates in Movember in the hope that there’ll be a cure in place if I get cancer.”The month of no shaving began unofficially in 2003, when a pair of men from Australia persuaded their pals to join them in growing a “mo” in order to encourage men to get themselves screened for cancer, which is seen as taboo by some males.A year later, the group decided to set up the Movember Foundation, asking acquaintances to offer donations of money to support their efforts, and raised a massive A$54,000 (280,000 yuan) which was shared between a number of health projects.With thanks most likely to social media, Movember soon went global and the foundation now operates worldwide, having raised over ￡440 million (3.7 billion yuan) since 2004.So where exactly do the millions go?“With [the] money raised, the foundation has funded over 1,200 game-changing programmes in *prostate cancer, *testicular cancer and suicide prevention around the world,” a spokesperson for the organization says.The effects of the fundraising are wide-reaching, with scientists at Ulster University in Northern Ireland telling the BBC just last month that they had made a “significant” discovery in the treatment of prostate cancer, thanks to money donated by the foundation.And Movember isn’t just for men. Thousands of “mo sisters” take an active role in fundraising, as well as encouraging male acquaintances to get screened for potentially deadly illnesses.The issue of some men being too *stubborn to visit their doctor for a checkup, or perhaps being raised in a culture of “tough it out,” has led some males to neglect their health, which may mean it could be too late if something potentially deadly did develop.However, Natasha Hill, director of marketing at Cancer Research UK, told the BBC she thinks that Movember is helping to break down the *stigma of male health by making it more accessible, meaning that men are more likely to visit their doctors thanks to the campaign.“They found a way to appeal to men in a way that other campaigns just don’t – with banter, and a sort of *blokey jokiness.”
