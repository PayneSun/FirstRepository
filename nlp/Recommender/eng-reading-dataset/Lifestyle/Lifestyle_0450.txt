Break the great walls of language
On university *campuses around China, young people greet each other with "Ni hao are you?"University student Shen Jiahui said learning English was important to young Chinese. But after two days in Australia, she and fellow student Wang Taojun said they had found few Australian students who could speak Chinese.Ms Shen, 20, and Mr Wang, 21, are among the top winners of China’s Daily’s 21st Century Cup, the country’s most *prestigious English speaking competition, attracting almost 10,000 *entrants from 850 universities across China.Their study tour of Sydney with educational provider Navitas English *coincides with a decline in foreign languages among students in Australia."Learning English is not a subject for me, it’s a tool to communicate," Ms Shen said."If people are interested in China it would be better if they learn Chinese because they can better understand the culture."China Daily deputy editor Shen Gang said it would be helpful if both Australians and Chinese spoke each other’s language.However Chinese is a difficult language to learn and English will remain the working language of the world.Mr Shen said there were more students from the US and UK than Australians at Chinese universities."I hope there will be more Australian students come to China.""China is now the major business partner for Australia and also there are more Chinese tourists coming to Australia.""Once you learn Chinese a simple *greeting like Ni hao will help you to start a business."
