But Shaxi in Yunnan, which, many don’t realize, also comes to life with the flowers in spring, and offers a variety of untouched cultural gems.Shaxi village was a crucial node on chama gudao, the ancient Tea and Horse Caravan Route, which is less famous than the Silk Road but arguably of equal importance in terms of what it did for cultural and economic exchange.Hiking along a part of the trail can be arduous, but when you see the gorgeous rural landscape– wooden houses, winding streets and ancient courtyards–everything will be worthwhile.Shaxi is located halfway between Dali and Lijiang and is surrounded by mountains that discourage mass tourism, allowing its original beauty to remain intact.This spring more than 500 mu (333,333 square meters) of rapeseed flowers will come into bloom across the village, making for breathtaking views.Shaxi is “a wonderful sleepy place where nightlife means sitting out under the canopy of stars and listening to the frogs croaking in the rice paddies”, Lonely Planet writes.It takes about 90 minutes by car and three hours by bus to get from Lijiang to Shaxi.Luoyang, HenanPeonies, history and culture convenePeony blossoms bring a burst of color to Luoyang every spring.Peony fever in Luoyang dates back to the Tang Dynasty, when emperors, especially Emperor Xuanzong, favored the flowers and promoted them as cultural icons.As the flowers symbolized wealth and honor, they not only appeared in  textiles, artwork and architecture, but also in poetry. Li Bai once compared imperial concubine Yang Yuhuan to a peony for the attention she commanded in the imperial court.Even today, vestiges of peony culture remain visible in Luoyang sculptures and fashion.Wangcheng Park in the northern part of Luoyang is the center of the annual spring Peony Cultural Festival. This state-level event, which kicks off on April 5 and lasts for one month, features peony exhibitions as well as art performances.The festival “sees the park flooded with color, floral aficionados, photographers, girls with garlands on their heads and hawkers selling huge bouquets of flowers”, according to Lonely Planet.Hangzhou, ZhejiangTea plantation tranquility and gourmet beveragesBoth Longjing and Meijiawu tea plantations in Hangzhou are prime spots to escape the seasonal hustle and bustle and enjoy the unique flavors of Hangzhou-style cuisine.As spring breaks in Hangzhou, farmers begin their shuffle along the town’s idyllic terraces, hand picking tender leaves off of fragrant bushes. After the leaves have been delicately hand-roasted, visitors can then drink a freshly-brewed cup in a local farmhouse.You don’t have to be a tea connoisseur to visit. Chefs from local restaurants offer unique dining experiences by commonly integrating green tea as an ingredient in their dishes. Foodies highly recommend Longjing shrimp and the area’s wide variety of green-tea flavored desserts.Hangzhou is also home to some of southeastern China’s most immaculate views. When visitors plant their feet beside tea bushes and peer out beyond the hillside, a classic Chinese watercolor of misty hills, lush woodlands, ancient bridges and traditional farmhouses comes into view.The nearby National Tea Museum is dedicated to the art of tea and the cultivation of the crop, and is designed to add deeper value to visitors’ experiences. There, tourists can sample various brews and learn the history and health benefits of Chinese tea.
