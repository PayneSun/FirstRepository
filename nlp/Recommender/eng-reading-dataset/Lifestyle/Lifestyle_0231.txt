Young hit open road
Traveling for leisure is usually something people do when they have money to spare. But today’s young people travel longer and farther than previous generations, even though they don’t have much money; some don’t even have a job.It is a worldwide trend that more and more young people are interested in traveling. In a report released in 2012, the United Nation’s World Tourism Organization estimated that in the year 2011, 20 percent of all international tourists, or nearly 200 million travelers, were young people. Young tourists generate more than $180 billion (1.12 trillion yuan) in annual tourism revenue, an increase of nearly 30 percent since 2007. The UN attributes that growth both to rising incomes in emerging economies and a commitment by youth in developed countries to “continue traveling despite economic uncertainty”.In the US, the Millennial generation, defined as those between ages 16 and 34, is more interested than older generations in traveling abroad, despite the economic downturn and high unemployment rates, according to a 2013 Boston Consulting Group report.Another recent report, released by The World Youth Student and Educational (WYSE) Travel Confederation, which surveyed more than 34,000 people from 137 countries, found that young travelers are not as interested in “the traditional sun, sea and sand holidays” as previous generations. They are spending less time in “major gateway cities” and instead exploring more remote destinations, and choosing long backpacking trips over short breaks.No longer a luxuryThe study showed an increase from 2007 in young travelers taking trips longer than two months, with the average trip lasting 58 days.Amanda Machado, writing in The Atlantic website, says with easy access to social media and budget-travel tools like Airbnb, Couchsurfing, Skyscanner, and Lonely Planet message boards, long-term travel isn’t as expensive as some may imagine.Many young people are looking for meaningful experiences in their travels. Carrie Barker, writing on tourism marketing website MilesPartnership.com, says today’s young people are more interested in bragging about what they just did in social media than showing off what they just bought. “Millennials care about checking in at the most buzz-worthy restaurants, or posting artfully filtered selfies from remote beaches to shamelessly promote our cool factor,” she says.Many young people are also using traveling as a form of job training. According to the WYSE Travel Confederation’s report, 22 percent of respondents wanted to learn a language during their travels, 15 percent wanted to gain more work experience, and 15 percent wanted to study — all increases on 2007.
