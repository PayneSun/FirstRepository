Winner of the "World's Ugliest Dog" contest
A British dog named Mugly has taken the title of the World’s Ugliest Dog at the annual contest, which was held in Northern California on Friday.Mugly is an 8-year-old Chinese crested with several ugly features, including a crooked nose, white whiskers and large, beady eyes, which helped it win the award, notes The Associated Press. The dog beat out 28 others from all around the world for the prize, which includes $1,000 and a year’s supply of dog treats. It will also get to do a photo shoot and a VIP stay at the local Sheraton hotel.“I couldn’t speak when they announced Mugly’s name,” said Bev Nicholson, the dog’s owner, after Mugly was crowned the winner. “I didn’t know which way to look. I was shaking as much as the dog.” Nicholson added that Mugly was previously named Britain’s ugliest dog in 2005.In case you get worried that Mugly might feel insulted by the award, host and pet psychic Sonya Fitzpatrick told Mercury News that Mugly and the others have no objection to being called “ugly.” They just love the attention they get.Mugly and the others were judged on their natural ugliness and then competed against past winners, who are known as the “Ring of Champions.” Judges and the audience picked the eventual winner.The competition took place at the Marin-Sonoma Fairgrounds in Petaluma, just north of San Francisco.Chinese crested appear to be favorites to win every year. Yoda, a Chinese crested and Chihuahua mix, won last year.Mugly will go on to make appearances on talk shows and local UK events.
