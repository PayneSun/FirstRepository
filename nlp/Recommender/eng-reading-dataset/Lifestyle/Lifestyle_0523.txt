Legacy of Lei Feng lives on
He Qiangcheng, 22, a senior and geology major from Sichuan Normal University, has almost given up trying to act like his childhood hero, Lei Feng.“I once tried to help a woman with heavy luggage, and she gave me a suspicious look,” he complains.“Then another time, when I returned a lost dining card to the canteen, the staff asked me to use up the cash on it rather than bothering to find the owner.”But, despite having met with rejections, He still wants to be like his idol.His hero, Lei Feng, was a People’s Liberation Army soldier who came to represent altruism, modesty and devotion.March 5 will mark the 50th year of Lei’s death. In 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong designated the day as “Learn From Lei Feng Day” and started a national campaign for people to copy his deeds.Several decades after the campaign was initiated, there has been a debate about whether the spirit of Lei lives on, and whether an altruistic role model is relevant anymore in a materialist society.Some think it no longer rings a bell. “In a world when everyone emphasizes the importance of ‘me’, many of my peers think there’s little ground for giving up one’s interests purely for the sake of others,” says Lin Zi’en, 19, a sophomore English major from South China Normal University in Guangdong.Commentators, however, point out those who regarded Lei’s spirit as being outdated have misinterpreted its meaning.Yang Haibin, deputy secretary of China Communist Youth League Beijing Committee said: “learning from Lei Feng could be a mutually caring and benefiting act, which is the basis of civilized society.And, Lei’s spirit can be modern and relevant, says Yang. He believes that lending a helping hand for no reward is an early form of volunteering.“It’s also about being content with a simple and humble way of life,” Yang says.Hu Danhua, 21, an international business major from China University of Political Science and Law, agrees. “I’ve gained peace of mind and spiritual fulfillment through small acts of kindness, such as teaching village pupils. I could obtain it from nowhere else,” Hu says.In a society with material abundance but a lack of moral fiber, it seems hard to cherish the Lei Feng spirit.Reports of passers-by hesitating to help people in need are shocking. Cases in which good Samaritans have landed in trouble are well publicized.But Liu Jifeng, director of the military high technology training department at the National University of Defense Technology, says it is important to help others as much as you can. “If everyone turns a blind eye to the bad side, our whole social system will be in danger,” Liu says.As Lei Feng’s anniversary draws near, his spirit has been promoted in a more approachable way.Guangdong provincial government has updated its campaign slogan from “sacrificing yourself to benefit others” to “doing each other a favor”.In Changsha, Hunan, the hometown of Lei Feng, the slogan is “doing my duty”.Lei’s followers among the post-80s and 90s generation regard these moves as humanizing the role model.They’re encouraged to develop their unique interpretation and ways of spreading goodwill.For instance, Shan Haiping, 19, a freshman English major from Zhejiang Ocean University, believes the spirit means guarding one’s principles.“It’s about doing things you feel worthwhile,” she said.Hu Zhongping, professor of education in South China Normal University, says Lei Feng’s spirit teaches us to be a good person, who contributes to society.“It’s all about encouraging those who are self-centered to think from other people’s perspectives as well,” Hu says.
