Beijing urban administrator comes clean in new book
An urban administrator in Beijing has been thrust into the spotlight after the release of his new bestselling book in which he openly discusses working in the city management system, China Youth Daily reports."Chengguan: an Insider’s View" by Song Zhigang, a Beijing chengguan (urban administrator who is responsible for city management), tackles the role of chengguans in China, which has long been a major issue of contention because of their love-hate relationship with city residents.While their job duties include helping people and making the city better, they also must crack down on street vendors who operate without a license. While the chengguans receive smiles and thank-yous from local residents, they also are constantly showered in sarcasm for stripping people of their livelihoods and being inhumane and violent.In his book, Song shares his personal experiences as a chengguan and says he believes there are inadequacies in China’s city management system. He expresses his opinion on the social problems that are common in Beijing and across China, which show no sign of abating despite all the efforts to solve them.Song also touches upon recent hot topics that are both attention-grabbing and controversial with a hint of humor and attempt to tease. For example, he comments on three deadly accidents involving school buses, which all occurred in one month, saying: "It wouldn’t hurt to spend some money on improving school bus safety given all the money that the government has wasted."Song also said he would smash the luxurious chandelier in a state-owned enterprise, which cost an extravagant 8 million yuan.Despite his seemingly lighthearted tone, Song said he performs his job duties with reason and respect and believes nothing is unsolvable with better understanding among all people."The current city management is far from satisfactory," he writes. "Chengguans are rude and violent, which makes both the residents and us unhappy. It just won’t work. Our city should be more tolerant, more people-oriented and more beautiful."In "Chengguan: an Insider’s View," Song speaks eloquently about the rights and wrongs of both chengguans and the public and expresses his hopes and vision for the future."I can’t change the whole country, but I can do something to make it better," he writes. "Becoming a chengguan was my choice, and I’m proud of it."
