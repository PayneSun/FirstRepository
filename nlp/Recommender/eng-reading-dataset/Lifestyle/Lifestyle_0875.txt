Cooking mother invited to White House
The mother-of-three was told in 2004 that she was close to death after suffering three heart attacks in a week because of a rare condition which had damaged one of the main arteries to her heart. Five years ago one of the main arteries in her heart ruptured and her husband, Dogan Halil, 45, rushed to say goodbye. "He was sobbing and kept telling me he loved me. I was conscious but I couldn’t speak. I was just concentrating on breathing. At one point I thought I had actually died," Miss Bee told the Daily Express. "But then I thought about the children and I looked at him and realised I was alive and the battle began." But the 41 year-old, of Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, survived and has managed to stay healthy with the help of a new diet. That new diet, which includes healthy sausage and mash and ratatouille chicken tray bake, is the basis for her cookbook, The Secret Ingredient. She has now been invited to cook with Mrs Obama in the White House in March next year, after the First Lady became a fan of her recipes. Miss Bee said: "I spoke to Michelle Obama’s office and they invited me to come and see her vegetable garden and for us to cook together. ""I am absolutely thrilled. To think that my book has been picked up by someone so powerful is just fantastic. It makes it all so worthwhile."She added: "It’s so exciting. I think we both have a very similar philosophy on food. We are both very keen on promoting healthy eating that is affordable."She has also received a letter from Prince Albert of Monaco requesting "some of my immune-building recipes "I guess if it’s good enough for Mrs Obama, then it will be good enough for him too," she said.
