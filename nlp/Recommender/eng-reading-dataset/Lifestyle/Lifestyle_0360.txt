British men want miniskirts banned!
Men want hotpants, miniskirts and low cut tops banned from the office because they are too distracting, new research shows.A study found that at least a third of men want women stopped from wearing revealing outfits at work, with skimpy shorts the first to go.Hotpants were named by 32 percent as unacceptable, with 30 percent adding that anything with a leopard print should be banned.See-through, or ’sheer’, tops were deemed beyond the pale by 27 percent of men, while 24 percent named miniskirts and 22 percent low cut tops.Meanwhile, 67 percent of women say colleagues should be stopped from wearing tiny shorts and 52 percent believe miniskirts are unprofessional.The study into British attitudes to clothes in the workplace, was carried out by the British Heart Foundation as it encourages people to wear red to the office on February 1.It found more than a third of women say wearing red makes them feel more confident.And 29 percent of women wish they had the courage to wear the colour more often.But the research, to mark BHF’s Rock up in Red day, found that, rather than appreciating glimpses of women’s cleavages and thighs, many men simply find it very off-putting.Other items of clothing to get the thumbs down, included slogan T-shirts (deemed inappropriate by 32 percent of Brits) and novelty ties (26 percent).UGG boots should be banned from the office too, according to 26 percent, and 23 percent want leggings shown the door.The report also revealed that wearing different colours has an impact on how we feel.One in ten women (13 percent) reveal they would reach for their best red item in order to impress in the office.And 48 percent named a red dress as the sexiest thing they could wear.Meanwhile, a quarter (26 percent) say a touch of red lipstick boosts their confidence.
