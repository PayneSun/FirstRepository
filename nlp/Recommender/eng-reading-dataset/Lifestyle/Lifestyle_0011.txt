Difference in friendships
You may have heard the saying, women are from Venus and men are from Mars. It’s a nice way of saying how males and females are, in many ways, quite different from each other.These differences can be seen everywhere, even in how we communicate with friends. A recent study by the University of Oxford suggested that males and females keep long-distance relationships with friends of the same sex alive in different ways.Researchers questioned 30 students about their friendships just before they graduated from high school and moved away for college. They then followed up the questions nine months, and then 18 months, later.Robin Dunbar, who headed the research, told The Guardian: “What determined whether [friendships] survived with girls was whether they made an effort to talk more to each other on the phone.”Males, on the other hand, tended to do things differently. Most male respondents said they get through months of being apart from friends by arranging occasional meet-ups. “What held up their friendships was doing stuff together,” Dunbar told The Guardian.“Going to a football match, going to the pub for a drink ... They had to make the effort. It was a very striking sex difference.”Of course, genderisn’t the only thing that determines how we stay in touch. The way we keep our relationships alive comes down entirely to the preference of each person, and it can take a while to find your own way of making your friendships work. One thing that is definitely clear though is that friends who make the effort to stay in contact, even if it’s only through Skype once a week, do tend to stay friends, no matter what the distance.
