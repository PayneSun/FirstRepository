World's ‘ugliest woman’ gives courageous interview
She has been ridiculed, stared at in the street and called ’the world’s ugliest woman’ by insensitive cyber bullies.But, after years of misery and self-doubt, Lizzie Velasquez says she can finally shrug off the hurtful comments about her looks as ’just words’.Miss Velasquez, from Austin, Texas, was born without adipose tissue - meaning she has no body fat and, despite eating up to 60 small meals a day, remains at a delicate 4.4stone (58lbs).In Be Beautiful, Be You the 23-year-old college senior shares advice on being unique, how to make and keep good friends and how to deal with bullying and negativity.When asked how she deals with being constantly stared at in the street Miss Velasquez said: ’I’m starting to want to go up to these people and introduce myself or give them my card and say, "Hi, I’m Lizzie - maybe you should stop staring and start learning".’Miss Velasquez said when cyber bullies first started attacking her online it was hard. ’I’m human... of course these things are going to hurt... (but) I’m not going to let those things define me.’Eventually Miss Velasquez realised the people issuing the hurtful comments online were just cowards hiding behind a computer screen.Miss Velazquez has now written a second book about her struggle to be accepted and hopes it will help others in a similar position.Miss Velasquez was born four weeks prematurely weighing just 2lb 10oz. Doctors found there was minimal amniotic fluid protecting her in the womb.’They told us they had no idea how she could have survived,’ Miss Velasquez’s mother Rita, 45, a church secretary, said.’We had to buy dolls’ clothes from the toy store because baby clothes were too big.’ Doctors could not make a diagnosis so they prepared Miss Velasquez’s parents for the worst.’They told us she would never be able to walk, talk or have a normal life,’ said her mother, who has two other children with Miss Velasquez’s father Lupe - both children are of average height and weight. “Miss Velasquez’s case has fascinated doctors all over the world and she is part of a genetic study run by Professor Abhimanyu Garg at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.Professor Garg and his team now believe Miss Velasquez may have a form of Neonatal Progeroid Syndrome (NPS), which causes accelerated ageing, fat loss from the face and body, and tissue degeneration.He said: ’I am aware of a small number of people that have similar conditions to Lizzie but each case is slightly different.’We cannot predict what will happen to Lizzie in the future, as the medical community are yet to document older people with NPS.’However Lizzie is lucky to have healthy teeth, organs and bones so the outlook is good. We will continue to study her case and learn from her.’Miss Velasquez doesn’t take medication but she relies on vitamin supplements and iron to stay healthy. It is thought she should be able to conceive naturally without passing the condition to her children.
