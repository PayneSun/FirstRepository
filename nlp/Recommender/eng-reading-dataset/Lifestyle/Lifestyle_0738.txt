Post-80s feel the pressure
When Yu Bingbing, a 28-year-old market research manager, is on her way to work each morning, she always cannot help feeling anxious about whether she has locked the door of her apartment and turned off the gas."I’m usually wrestling with these feelings for the entire day," Yu said.Working at an international pharmaceutical firm, Yu looks older than she is and her heavily made-up face always has an exhausted look."Since I have been promoted to a managerial position, I lose my temper with my parents and husband more frequently just because of some trivial things," she said, adding that slight wrinkles and acne on her face have irritated her even more, and even luxury cosmetics cannot help her."I have to work six days a week and don’t even have extra off time when I’m sick," she said. "I have to push myself to become a workaholic since the competition in my company is really fierce and I also have to pay a 5,000 yuan monthly mortgage, besides saving a certain amount of money for my planned baby."Life is like riding on a rollercoaster for Yu and many other members of China’s post-80s generation, the first generation born after the introduction of the family-planning policy and the group to benefit most from the country’s opening-up policy and its booming economy.Being the only child in their family, and without much to trouble them during their youth, most of them were taken good care of or even spoiled by their parents and grandparents.Having such a relatively carefree youth - when this generation reached adulthood and had to cope with soaring prices, the high cost of raising children and intense competition in the workplace - they suffered a rude awakening.According to statistics, the population of China’s post-80s generation is over 200 million. The media usually refers to them as "slaves" to property, credit cards, children and marriage.According to the "White Book on the Health Condition of China’s Urban White-Collar Workers", 76 percent of white-collar workers in China’s major cities are in worse than average health, with nearly 60 percent being over-fatigued.The survey showed that nearly 80 percent of white-collar workers in China suffer from irregular sleep and diets and feel tired every day. In addition, more than half feel irritable, 20 percent feel lonely, and more than 70 percent are unhappy.But Xiong Hanzhong, director of Beijing Youth Stress Management Service Center, told China Business Weekly that the post-80s generation shouldn’t complain too much because people of all ages have to bear the burden caused by high property prices and many other adverse factors.Xiong said: "It is inappropriate for them to rush to get their own car or apartment as their savings are limited. Why can’t they temporarily rent an apartment like many other young people in other countries?"Members of the post-80s generation, who generally have a good educational background and also have profound insights into many issues, should be confident about their future because of their talent and potential, added Xiong.They shouldn’t underestimate their own capabilities and constantly bemoan their fate, he said.If people feel relieved after shopping, buying useless items or eating and drinking to excess, then it is a sign of great pressure, he said. If you’re unable to control or make adjustments, you should seek professional psychiatric help, he added.Henry Sheng, China marketing director of Hay Group, a global management consultancy, said that employers can take some measures to help relieve the pressure on their staff, but what’s more important is that employees themselves should learn how to manage their emotions and deal with stress.
