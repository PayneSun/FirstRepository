Why do people hate their bosses?
Hate your boss? New research shows you’re not alone.A study by talent management expert DDI revealed that one in three employees don’t consider their boss to be doing an effective job, while nearly half of workers think they could do their boss’s job better than them.Conducted as a way to determine what today’s leaders are doing right and what they are doing wrong, the research also found that fewer than 40 percent of employees are motivated by their supervisor to give their best effort.Much of the dissatisfaction stems from supervisors’ unwillingness to listen to their employees. Thirty-five percent of the surveyed workers said their boss never, or only sometimes, listens to their work-related concerns.Additionally, only 54 percent of supervisors involve employees in making decisions that affect their work.The study also shows too many leaders aren’t delivering on the basic requirements – courtesy, respect, honesty and tact in their interactions – of a healthy manager/employee relationship.Sixty percent of those surveyed reported their boss has damaged their self-esteem, while nearly one-third of employees said their supervisor doesn’t remain calm and constructive when discussing problems.The lack of faith in their boss is forcing many to consider other employment. Nearly 40 percent of those surveyed said they left a job primarily because of their leader, while more than half said their negative perception of a boss had them contemplating finding a new employer.There are areas, however, where supervisors scored high marks. The research shows 74 percent of workers understand their boss’s expectations of them, while 66 percent said their manager provides the support they need.The research was based on surveys of more than 1,200 full-time employees from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India and southeast Asia.
