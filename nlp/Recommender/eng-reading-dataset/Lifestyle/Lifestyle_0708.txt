Company delivering on fast promises
So, you always order books on Dangdang.com, or Amazon.cn. You pay extra because you want to receive them quickly–and you still won’t get the books until the next day.Next time you go to Kuaishubao.com and see the ad that says “book delivery within an hour”, don’t doubt it. The online bookstore, which was launched in June in Beijing, offers fast-food style book delivery.“We divide the inner city into small areas, and each warehouse can cover customers within three square kilometers,” Said Xu Zhiming, founder of Kuaishubao.com, explaining the secret of their fast service.To ensure that books can reach customers within an hour, Xu set up about 20 warehouses (10x20 square meters each) in the inner city of Beijing, hired more than 30 express delivery people and equipped them with electric bikes.The delivery capacity is 600 orders per day in Beijing, due to stock limitations and delivery time restrictions. Maybe that’s why you will find there are only about 300 book titles on the website.“We mainly choose best-sellers and books which are worth reading,” Xu said. “If Dangdang and Amazon are the Walmart of the book sector, we are more like 7-Eleven–speed and convenience is our thing.”Currently Kuaishubao’s services are only available in Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an, Chengdu and Tianjin.Kings of convenience demand instant serviceJapanIn Japan, having goods sent to your door is called “takuhaibin”.
