Name may make looks
Do you look like your name? Scientists say there’s a good chance you do.This comes from a new study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Researchers from Israel found that our given names may carry social stereotypes (成见), which can be seen in our facial appearances.Lead author Yonat Zwebner of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, along with her team, carried out eight separate studies involving hundreds of participants (参与者) in Israel and France. The different experiments were set up to answer two main questions: whether people can accurately guess a person’s name based only on a headshot (头像) and what is behind this matching effect.During the experiments, researchers asked students to look at photos of people’s faces and guess each person’s name from a list of four choices. The participants correctly guessed the right name 38 percent of the time, which was better than the 25 percent rate of a random (随机的) one-in-four guess.What’s more, the students were able to best match the faces to the names when the faces they looked at came from within their own culture. French students were better at matching only French names and faces while Israeli students were better at matching only Hebrew names and Israeli faces.Researchers believe it is possible that people change their appearance without being aware (意识到) of it, to match social norms (规范) carried by their names. One study in particular backed up this idea, showing that a hairstyle, something that can be changed by individuals (个人) easily, was enough to guide people in accurately guessing their names.“Earlier research has shown there are cultural stereotypes carried by names, including how someone should look. For example, people are more likely to imagine a person named Bob to have a rounder face than a person named Tim. We believe these stereotypes can, over time, influence people’s facial appearance,” Zwebner concluded.The results of the experiment may even make parents think twice when choosing a name for their child.“If a name can influence appearance, it can influence many other things and this research opens an important direction that may suggest how parents should consider better the names they give their children,” said Zwebner, who recently had a baby herself.“As parents, it was really difficult for us to name our 12-day-old daughter as we are aware of the implication (意义) of names.”
