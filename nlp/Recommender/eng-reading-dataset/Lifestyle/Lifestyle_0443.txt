Travel book fills a gap
Zhou Liqun and Shen Yiming study unusual majors – Sanskrit and Hindi – at Peking University.This July, 27-year-old postgraduate Zhou and 22-year-old undergraduate Shen, both in the department of South Asian Studies, launched the first Indian travel guide written by university students.It is called Under the Bodhi Tree and Above the Ganges River.It all began with their one-year stay in New Delhi for a language course in late 2010.In response to requests from friends, Zhou and Shen posted their travel notes on a blog from early last year.They depicted the fun and games of the Holi Festival, when everyone drenches their beloved ones with colored water.They described Sikhism, a religion that reveres honesty and collaboration, with nuanced writing.As their travel posts went viral among friends and travel magazines, they were challenged by an editor to write a book.Their travel routes cover large parts of India.“Having lived in cosmopolitan Beijing for six years, what I saw in India was like a new wave of delightful visual images,” said Zhou.Wherever they went, they had the feeling that they were surrounded by old buildings in warm colors and an array of multi-colored saris.“I fell in love with India when I read a poem in Mahabharata, an Indian epic, about the romance between prince Nala and princess Damayanti. It is so well-written,” said Zhou.Zhou loves Indian literature, while her fellow co-writer Shen majors in Hindi, which contributes to their complementary knowledge of the culture and religion of Indian society.In the winter of last year, the duo visited the city of the dead, Varanasi. In this religious capital of India, the dead are cremated on the river bank and their ashes thrown in the Ganges.“Samsara is the core belief of Hinduism. They believe that being scattered in the Ganges will result in a better next life,” said Shen.Shen and Zhou stood by the river bank, watching dozens of corpses wrapped in cloth, decorated with fresh flowers, gradually devoured by fire.“The family seemed so composed. Whether there was underneath disquiet on those expressionless faces was hard to tell, but I could feel the tranquilizing power of religion,” said Zhou.As the pair wandered across India, Zhou got to thinking: as we gallop through our lives shouldn’t we stop for a while to think?“I once spotted a man meditating by a river,” said Zhou. “He looked so ethereal against the orange sunset. It reminded me of what Elizabeth Gilbert described in Eat, Pray, Love, that meditation is about reaching a state where God dwells within you, as you,” said Zhou.“Our book is just one of the achievements of our Indian culture pilgrimage,” said Shen.“Maybe we need years of contemplation to realize what we truly acquired from our stay in India.”
