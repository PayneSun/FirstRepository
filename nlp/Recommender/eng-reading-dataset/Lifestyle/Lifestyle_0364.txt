Improving the safety of our road network
Turning left under a bridge in Beijing, Hu Xingxin, 24, suddenly screeched to a stop in front of a yellow light at a busy crossroad.“According to the new traffic regulations, running a yellow light is equal to running a red one,” said the Beijing-based IT technician. “Since the new rules came into effect I’m always ready to hit the brakes to avoid a penalty.“Authorities have since changed the rules and running a yellow light no longer results in a 6-point deduction.New traffic regulations are the latest measure to improve road safety, which has become a problem in China. Experts say that to achieve better road safety, various and comprehensive methods are needed. Updating the rules are only part of the story.“Traffic accidents have become a serious problem for public safety,” said Wang Yong, a public health emergency consultant from the Ministry of Health.More than 68,000 road accidents, resulting in 794 deaths, more than 100 a day, occurred in China during the last National Day holiday, according to the Ministry of Public Security. The ministry also revealed that in 2011, 62,000 people died from road accidents.“Traffic accidents are becoming a development crisis,” World Health Organization (WHO) director general Margaret Chan told The Guardian last month.According to the WHO, traffic accidents kill more people around the world than malaria and are the leading cause of death for young people aged 5 to 29 - especially in developing countries.Each year up to 1.3 million people are killed and more than 50 million injured in traffic accidents around the world.The economic consequences are also significant: According to a study by the World Bank and Harvard University, traffic accidents on average cost a country 1 to 3 percent of its annual Gross National Product. The WHO reported that road accidents cost the world more than $500 billion (3.11 trillion yuan) a year.The newly revised regulations impose much heavier penalties on drivers who violate traffic rules. Under the new regulations, 52 different violations result in penalties, up from 38 under the previous system.Eleven kinds of violations now result in the deduction of 12 points, compared to six points under the previous regulation. These violations include drunken driving and using fake license plates.“The heavier penalties will force drivers to follow traffic regulations,” said Chen Yanyan, a professor at Beijing University of Technology’s Transport Research Center. But she added that traffic regulations are only one aspect of many regarding problems with road safety in China.According to Chen, other components of road safety include technology and urban design.
