Torch song fizzles out
If an Olympic-themed song is supposed to inspire competitors to new athletic heights, Survival, the official Olympics song from British rock band Muse, is hardly a good example.Charting in the UK at No 25, the song is way outside the medal position. It invites the question: does anyone really care about Olympic songs?If you need a group to capture the excitement of the world’s biggest sporting event, Muse would seem to be the perfect band to pen a great Olympic anthem.But Survival lacks drama. During its five-plus minutes, we *encounter an *orchestra, guitar work, a piano *riff, lead singer Matt Bellamy’s *wailing *falsetto, and *cheesy lyrics.“It’s a race, and I’m gonna win,” he sings–overblown and pretentious.Muse is not alone in writing a less-than-inspiring Olympic song. Christopher Cross’ A Chance for Heaven, the official track of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, was far from a personal best; Celine Dion’s The Power of the Dream, performed at Atlanta in 1996, was nothing surprising.So why do these songs keep getting made? There’s a certain amount of *one-upmanship at play.No one wants to be the country without an Olympic anthem. Pop music is also part of the British national identity.If any nation is entitled to write an Olympic song, surely it’s the one that brought the world The Beatles and Queen.However, unlike a soccer tournament, the Olympics are a weeks-long *frenzy of sports and competition of national interests.The opening and closing ceremonies can barely sum up the event–how could one pop song hope to do the same?“You can’t capture a nation’s mood with an Olympic song because there isn’t the same *fanaticism for the event as there is for, say, the national soccer team,” John Aizlewood, who writes for Q magazine, told The Atlantic.Perhaps that’s why, in the US at least, the only Olympic tunes to ever stick around have been wordless, modern-classical works of *pomp and circumstance: John Williams’ Olympic Fanfare and Theme–recorded for the 1984 games in Los Angeles–and Leo Arnaud’s Bugler’s Dream, which ABC played before its 1964 Olympic broadcasts.Muse *makes a stab for orchestral *grandeur with an extended string-section *prelude, but then Bellamy’s wailing kicks in, and we’re *jolted back to radio territory.If Olympic singalong songs are *doomed from the start, no one seems to have told the 2012 organizers.Elton John, Mark Ronson and The Chemical Brothers have all been signed up to release Olympic singles.Will they be able to capture the public’s imagination in a way that Survival has failed? The track record would suggest otherwise.
