Former world's fattest man finds love
He was once the world’s fattest man weighing in at a staggering 70 stone and consuming a mammoth 20,000 calories a day.But it seems that after losing 48 stone following NHS surgery, it’s not just Paul Mason’s health that has a more promising outlook - his weight loss may have also boosted his love life.Mr Mason has only known his new girlfriend Rebecca for a month and the pair are yet to meet, but already the 52-year old claims that Rebecca is the love of his life.The pair met online last month when Rebecca saw a television documentary about Mr Mason’s extreme obesity - the result, he says, of overeating when a previous relationship ended.She was so touched by his plight that Rebecca got in touch via Facebook keen to help Mr Mason in his bid to get the NHS to pay for a second operation to rid him of layers of excess skin.Mr Mason said: ’She didn’t really think anything romantically to start with. I didn’t know anything about her and we talked all about her life and how she wants to help me.’’It wasn’t until the second conversation that I realised there was more there than just friends. She felt the same and brought up the idea of us being boyfriend and girlfriend.’Mr Mason says that he doesn’t go for looks and finds Rebecca’s determined attitude particularly attractive. He said: ’I am more interested in the person rather than the physical side of things.’It is her personality, her drive and passion and she has a lovely smile that made me fall for her. It was hard for me to accept to start with because part of me is still trapped in this loose skin and I find it hard to understand how anyone can see through that.’We share the same ideas, interests, and outlook on life and she has made me look at life in a new way. I’m more determined than ever to get this operation and enjoy my life with her.’’For a long time I couldn’t really see light at the end of the tunnel. But since Rebecca’s been in my life I’ve got a whole new sense of worth and excitement.’Mr Mason ballooned to his incredible size by eating ten times the amount needed by a normal man due to a compulsive eating disorder. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers.Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed an operation in 2002.Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around.
