The top 50 things people want to do before they die
Seeing the seven wonders of the world, going on safari in Africa and swimming with dolphins are among the list of 50 things the average person wants to do before they die.But sadly researchers have found that most adults will only ever fulfill five of their lifelong ambitions.Many feel they do not have enough time to tick off the experiences, while others admit to not being fit or adventurous enough or being too afraid of getting hurt.Becoming a millionaire, traveling the world, seeing the Northern Lights, trekking the Great Wall of China and being mortgage free are the top five respectively on the checklist of dreams.Among the other less surprising entries are writing a novel, learning to speak another language, visiting the Egyptian pyramids and running a marathon.But ambitions that might fairly be considered less universal also feature, including travelling around New Zealand in a Winnebago motor home, inventing something that changes people lives, riding a Segway scooter and going to Harry Potter World in Florida.Other boxes to tick range from gambling in Las Vegas, driving down Route 66 in the United States and visiting Disneyland to meeting the Queen, learning to fly a helicopter and emigrating.The list was complied following a study commissioned by outdoor clothing company Helly Hansen of 2,000 adults.More than one third of people surveyed complained that they did not have enough time to achieve their ambition, while 20 percent were worried about injuries.More than a quarter also did not believe they were fit enough to attempt their ultimate goal and 12 percent confessed that had no ambitions at all.Nearly half also realised that they have to be more adventurous to achieve their ambitions.A spokesperson from Helly Hansen told The Daily Express: ’It is fantastic to see that so many people still have a passion for taking to the outdoors in order to experience new challenges.’But it is a real shame to see that some may not achieve lifelong ambitions because of a lack of faith in their own ability.’We are only too aware of the positive mental effects and increased confidence associated with physical activity in an outdoor environment.’Setting yourself a yearly goal can be a great motivator, whether your goal is to run a marathon, climb a mountain or simply improve your general health and well-being.’
