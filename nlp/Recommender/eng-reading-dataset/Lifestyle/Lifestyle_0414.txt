Chinese tourists 2nd most annoying in world
Zhang Siyu, 25, who works as an agent for a performance company in Beijing, went on a cruise trip from Singapore to Malaysia in August.But the stunning views from the ship’s deck didn’t provide much pleasure, as a group of Chinese compatriots playing cards laughed raucously nearby.Most passengers were Westerners. “At that moment, as a Chinese I wished I could find a hole in the ground and hide,” she recounted. “I was in no mood to appreciate the view.”As more and more Chinese tourists travel abroad, some of their behavior is raising eyebrows.According to the latest 2012 LivingSocial survey, Chinese tourists were recently ranked second behind US citizens in a global poll of the worst travelers.Liu Deqian, researcher and deputy director of the Tourism Research Center at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Chinese visitors often lack an awareness of being courteous or behaving appropriately.“On their first or second time abroad, Chinese visitors tend to forget that they are visiting other people’s homeland and overlook the etiquette of their hosts,” he said.Li Kefu, vice chairman of the International Leisure Industry Association, says that Chinese travelers’ ignorance of international customs and manners “will certainly produce a very bad national image”.According to experts, Chinese people lack access to information regarding the cultural customs of foreign countries, as well as international behavior guidelines.For instance, Chinese might not be aware of travel manners on certain transportation means such as airplanes, as evidenced by two recent fight incidents.Wang Jing, 30, an accounting professional in Hebei, travels extensively. He found that many Chinese do not tip waiters or luggage carriers in Europe.“It’s not because they don’t have any money,” he said. “They just don’t know that they should give a tip, or don’t know how much is appropriate.”Zhang Guanren, 28, who helped organize package tours to Australia, observed that on international flights, the first passengers to stand up and reach for luggage while the plane is still landing are often Chinese.“Our compatriots seem to lack patience, and they’re forever in a rush to do things and fear lagging behind others.”Some disregard rules in local wildlife parks: They disturb koalas in their natural habitats by touching them, even though the local guide has warned them against doing so. “This is far from being eco-friendly,” said Zhang.Professor Liu also thinks that wealthy Chinese travelers have become arrogant and have too big egos. “When they enjoy their privileges as a traveler, they forget to take into consideration others’ feelings and their duties.”But besides enjoying themselves, all travelers should respect local moral standards, taking care of the environment and protecting public property.Travel agencies should also impart a cultural awareness on travelers and help them gather information. Liu says that at least two overseas travel guides on civilized behavior have been published by authorities and another is being drafted. “Things will get better the more we advocate.”
