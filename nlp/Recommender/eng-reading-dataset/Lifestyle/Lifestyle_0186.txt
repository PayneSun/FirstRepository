In fixed momentum
Inspired by bicycle messengers and racers, a new group of Western youths are jetting through the city streets on fixed-gear bicycles. Now, the trend is gaining momentum on the streets of China.A fixed-gear bike is a bicycle whose pedals rotate at all times, even when coasting. To stop, riders must pedal in reverse, which diffentiates from road bikes. Due to their efficiency, fixies offer riders a new cycling perspective. Many young people use them as an alternative mode of transportation and as a leisure activity.Reliable and coolFixies not only are more economical to purchase and easy to maintain than geared bikes, but also possess a sleek appearance. These qualities appeal to youths lacking time and money but wanting to find cool ways to navigate cities.Chen Chi, a 23-year-old fixie enthusiast and event organizer, has noticed that more and more young people in Beijing like riding fixies.Apart from their reliability, Chen says fixed gear bikes make cycling cool. “Most people choose public transportation to visit places, but what I usually do is certainly out of the ordinary,” said Chen.More than a trendZhang Jiali, a 22-year-old graduate student at University of Hong Kong, was introduced to this type of bicycle during her sophomore year. She was so impressed with the bikes that she decided to turn her interest into a business. Zhang opened a fixie shop in Hong Kong, which her staff maintains in her absence. She sees riding fixies as a lifestyle choice rather than a trend.She and her friends travel in informal crews and share techniques.“When we are riding, we have the opportunity to look around and discover. It is not only a form of transportation, but a way of life,” said Zhang. “We burn calories instead of fuel, and the energy we utilize brings us to a better place.”
