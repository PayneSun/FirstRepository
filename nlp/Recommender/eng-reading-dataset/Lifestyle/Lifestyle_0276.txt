The key to living to 100?
Hardy pensioner Dorothy Howe has reached her 100th birthday - despite smoking nearly half a million cigarettes during her life.The retired secretary took her first drag aged 16 and has puffed her way through 15 Superking Black ciggies every day since then.She has smoked around 460,000 cigarettes over the last 84 years - costing £193,000 at today’s prices.But despite the obvious health risks, Dorothy believes smoking is the secret to her old age - and a regular drop of whisky.Relaxing with her favourite tipple of Bell’s, she said: ’I put my health down to whisky and cigarettes. I only drink when I’m out but my doctor said I wouldn’t be alive without them.’I’m still alive and I can lift my elbows - it’s great. I’ve had a great life and God has treated me very well. I’ve been very lucky.’“’I keep telling myself that I’m going to quit smoking when they put the prices up, but that’s just not going to happen now. Whisky tastes just as good as it used to though. My pins aren’t as fast as they used to be, but my mind is still sharp,’ she said.On her milestone birthday, friends took Dot to her local pub where she had a couple of drinks before returning home to open her card from the Queen. Friend Lynn Sass said: ’She has the respect and friendship of a lot of people around here. She’s wonderful and a great character.’She’s thought very highly of and we hope she’s had a great time. It’s a real achievement for a great woman.’
