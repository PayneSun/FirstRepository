Winning Formula: USA team tops IMO
Team USA won the first place at this year’s International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, reclaiming the crown after 21 years. The six US high school students defeated teams from 103 countries, including its strongest rival, China, which has won 14 times over the past 20 years. The U.S. edged out China by four points, 185-181.In 1980, the United States hockey team pulled off one of the greatest upsets in Olympic history, beating a powerhouse Soviet squad, 4-3, on its way to winning the gold medal. The game would go down in history as "The Miracle on Ice".Thirty-five years later, America pulled off another stunning upset. Team America has finally retaken the International Mathematical Olympiad crown. The victory this week was a historic comeback.If winning a youth math competition seems less important than vanquishing the Soviets back in 1980, consider this: the last time America won the IMO was 1994. Back then, Bill Clinton was president."It’s been 21 years," Team USA’s head coach, Po-Shen Loh, told The Washington Post. "This is a huge deal." He should know. Loh himself was a contestant back in 1999, when the U.S. slumped to 10th place.“This is a matter of national pride.” he explained. “One reason we are super excited is that for the past five years or so, we’ve been consistently second or third. It’s actually quite difficult to win. We are going up against a natural population disadvantage in the sense that China, which is the usual winner, has four times as many people.”The tournament consists of two tests on two days, each lasting four and a half hours. Students have to solve three problems a day, with each question worth seven points adding up to a 42-point total.The first questions on each day are the easiest and grow progressively harder. Most years, few students solve the third questions.
