Grads feel the pinch
Many college students complain about dorm life: a sweltering room without air-conditioning in summer and a dorm gate which is closed at 11 pm.But they may miss their dorms after graduation, when they have to spend as much as a third of their earnings on renting a shabby room.The rising prices of daily necessities, including food, water, gas and electricity, are also making grads pinch every penny to make ends meet.Faced with the high cost of living, college grads need to make every penny count when they budget their income.When it comes to renting, try to spend no more than one third of your income on it. Better still, only spend a quarter, according to Hao Qian, a career consultant with hiall.com.cn.Hao also reminds grads to set aside about one fifth of their income for social activities.“People have spent more on their social lives because of changes in forms of entertainment,” said Hao. For example, new friends may want to meet you at a spa club instead of at a hash house.In spite of the high cost of living, many college grads still try to stay in big cities. They usually work in industries such as finance, public relations (PR) and IT, which depend on a booming city economy and technology.Hao advises such grads to reduce their expenditure on shopping as much as possible. “If you are not in  jobs such as PR and sales which require you to dress well, you don’t need to spend much on clothes and *accessories,” said Hao. “Spend less than one eighth of your monthly income on shopping.”
