West mourns end of an age of innocence
Party invites, alcohol, tight-fitting outfits and famous lovers – these are the ingredients of celebrity life in the West. But, increasingly, they are must-haves for teenagers in the UK too. Growing up in a world in which fame is an aspiration and role models are short-skirted, painted singers such as Katy Perry, it’s little wonder that innocence is disappearing. And it shouldn’t come as a surprise that teenagers want to keep it that way.In high schools across the West, you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would list innocence as a positive attribute.Popular TV programs like Gossip Girl present a similar picture. Jenny Humphrey, not even 15 in series one of the show, is mocked for being young and naïve by Blair Waldorf’s “cool group”.It’s not until the second series, when “little J” starts dating, using make-up and wearing her school skirt several centimeters shorter, that she is accepted into the popular circle.The cult of celebrity and popularity of artists who sing about sex and the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle helps to explain the end of childhood innocence.It could also be that wanting to appear like an adult is linked to the desire for independence.In the West young people often believe they have the right to choose their own lifestyle rather than follow the wishes of their parents.Reaching adulthood is a much longed-for milestone.Of course, parents will always bemoan the loss of childhood innocence as they struggle to deal with children who are forced to confront issues like sex and violence a long time before they are emotionally able.However, there has been a small shift in recent years in the way that people in their 20s and 30s view innocence, at least in the way it’s connected with beauty.For at least a decade, the media has been saturated with fake-tanned, airbrushed celebrities. But in recent months, there have been several attempts to bring “real” women back into the spotlight.Debenhams, a UK department store, has banned airbrushing from swimwear ads. Essentials, a women’s magazine, has announced that its October issue will feature real people rather than models and celebrities.Yet the majority of brands which want to appeal to young people in the UK continue to play on the notion of sophistication, rather than innocence.British make-up brand Rimmel has hired model Kate Moss – renowned as a fun-loving party girl – to front their Rebellious Rimmel campaign several times in the past few years.
