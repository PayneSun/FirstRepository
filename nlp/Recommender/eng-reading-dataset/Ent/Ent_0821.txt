A cracking performance
It’s one of the most blogged and hyped pop singles in recent memory. The title was announced more than six months ago, with the lyrics leaked by the singer herself and Justin Bieber trying to predict what it would sound like. Lady Gaga’s first new song in over a year – Born This Way –arrived last week. The 24-year-old made the song’s debut performance on Monday’s 53rd Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.Gaga tells gay people to live life the way it suits them. The song serves as the perfect expression of putting cultural outsiders into the mainstream.But what does it sound like? Before you tune in to listen to the music, you may want to know what the critics have said.Reading a music review is usually a tough job for English learners. Here’s a typical piece of review of Born This Way in the Los Angeles Times. See how you can use English language to talk about music.Born This Way is massive in every way: It’s a huge-sounding single with a pulsating beat and a love-yourself message. It’s bound to pack dance-floors and blast from cars, computers and radios for weeks to come. The song is surprisingly reminiscent of Madonna  – recalling Express Yourself in several places and Vogue in the spoken bits – but in the best way possible. “It doesn’t matter if you love him or capital H-I-M,” Gaga says at the beginning of the song. “Just put your paws up, because you were born this way, baby.” The beat then comes crashing in and the song is off to the races, building and releasing tension in its multiple but fluid sections.The song is an ode to anyone who sees themselves as an outcast of society.  That is a theme on which the popular pop singer has built both her fan base and her own personal identity. LOS ANGELES TIMES
