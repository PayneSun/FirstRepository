UK's Prince Harry cavorts naked in Vegas party photos
Pictures of a naked Prince Harry were published on a US website on Wednesday, showing the grandson of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth cavorting with a nude young woman in a hotel room in Las Vegas.A royal source confirmed to reporters that the two photos published on the celebrity gossip website TMZ were of Harry, who has a reputation as a partying playboy and is often linked to an array of women in Britain’s tabloids."He’s been doing a lot of good work for the queen and getting a good reputation and although a lot of people think this is a great laugh, it does actually bring the monarchy into disrepute and will embarrass the queen," said royal author Robert Jobson.One snap showed Harry, third in line to the British throne, covering up his genitals with his hands while an apparently naked woman hides behind his back. The other pictured the naked 27-year-old prince clinging to a naked woman from behind."Prince Harry put the crown jewels on display in Vegas this weekend," TMZ said.According to TMZ, Harry and his friends had invited women from the hotel bar up to their VIP suite, where they played a strip game at a pool table. It did not identify the women.The prince, a British army Apache helicopter pilot, has been on a private holiday with friends in Las Vegas after completing his final pilot’s training ahead of a future deployment."We are not commenting specifically on the photos," a spokesman for the prince said.Harry, son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and his late ex-wife Princess Diana, earned a reputation when he was younger as a royal wild child after he admitted in 2002 dabbling in marijuana and under-age drinking. Three years later he made headlines when he wore a Nazi uniform to a costume party.But in recent years Harry has shed much of that image. He served in the army in Afghanistan four years ago and has spoken of his desire to return to frontline action.Earlier this month he was watched by hundreds of millions around the globe standing in for the queen while the national anthem was sung at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.The media has been enthralled by the love life of the single prince, whose elder brother William married last year in a ceremony that attracted huge global interest.
