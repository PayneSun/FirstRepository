Meet the Bearded Lady
A 23-year-old woman with a condition causing excessive hair development has revealed that growing a beard makes her feel more feminine.A beard first started to appear on her face aged just 11. The hair quickly spread to her chest and arms, and the condition made her the victim of taunts at school and on the street. She even received death threats from strangers over the internet.But Miss Kaur has now decided to stop cutting her hair after being baptised as a Sikh - a religion in which cutting body hair is forbidden.She said: ‘I would never ever go back now and remove my facial hair because it’s the way God made me and I’m happy with the way I am. I feel more feminine, more sexy. I’ve learned to love myself for who I am nothing can shake me now.’During her early teens, Miss Kaur was so ashamed of her beard that she waxed twice a week. But the hair became thicker and spread - with Miss Kaur feeling so self-conscious that she refused to leave her house. She even began self-harming and she considered suicide.But at the age of 16, everything changed for Miss Kaur when she decided to be baptised as a Sikh. It meant she would have to let her facial hair grow out.The decision proved controversial - especially with her family. Miss Kaur said: ‘My mum and dad didn’t want me to do it - they didn’t think I’d be able to have a normal life if I had a beard.’But Miss Kaur has been employed at a local Sikh primary school as a teaching assistant and her confidence has soared.Today Miss Kaur hopes her story will help other women find self-confidence. She has decided to share her story on YouTube - and continues to upload videos despite receiving death threats.
