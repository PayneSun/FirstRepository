Invasion of zombies hits TV
Zombies are officially the new vampires.The zombies in The Walking Dead terrified 10.5 million viewers last week. The show became the first cable series to win the US fall TV ratings this year, reported the Los Angeles Times.But why is a show promoted with the slogan “Spread the dead” such a hit with the living?According to experts, Americans love zombies because they represent whatever happens to be their greatest fear at the time.“You can’t shoot the financial meltdown in the head – you can do that with a zombie,” said Max Brooks, author of the best-selling Zombie Survival Guide.But the best thing about The Walking Dead is that it isn’t just about zombies. In this show they are more of a lens through which to observe the humans’ character and test their humanity to the limits.The story follows deputy sheriff Rick Grimes as he tries to lead his family and a small group of survivors to safety in a zombie-ridden world. Humans are the minority in this new landscape.To avoid being bitten by zombies – which would turn them into zombies – the living have to either hide from them or shoot off their heads. As time goes by and the survivors get used to the bloodshed, a recurring question arises: who are the real monsters?Each time they compromise their values in the name of survival, the human characters are pushed closer to something their former selves would have seen as inhuman.Rick, for example, used to be a man who upheld law and order before the zombie outbreak. In the first episode of Season One, when he has to pull the trigger on a legless zombie, he says “I’m sorry”. But at the conclusion of Season Two, he fatally stabs his former partner and best friend since high school. We see a man who has been changed by his nightmarish circumstances.A profound story of humanity aside, the show also harbors its appeal by featuring characters we can easily relate to – the pizza delivery boy, the abused woman, the old man who loves to give advice, the father and his son. They make us feel like a zombie apocalypse could hit us any moment.“We must keep watching to reassure ourselves that, if faced with a global meltdown, zombie-virus-related or otherwise, we could survive,” said Jen Chaney of The Washington Post.
