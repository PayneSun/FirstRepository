‘Planet of the Apes’ returns
I went into the cinema to check out a late-summer blockbuster about talking chimpanzees. But Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, underneath its gorilla suit, is a heavy movie that left me wondering heavy questions like “Why is there war?”Compared with 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the franchise reboot which focused heavily on character development and clean, bright visuals, the sequel takes a turn toward a much darker tone both visually and in the storytelling. We are constantly aware that danger is coming, and finding a peaceful solution seems impossible from the start.The film picks up a decade after what happened in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. When that 2011 film ended, the hero chimp Caesar — raised among people before experiencing animal-lab cruelty — led other mutated apes into the woods of San Francisco. This time, his peaceful existence is threatened by the intrusion of Malcolm, a man searching for energy supplies in the ruined city. The two form a truce, though growing distrust and militant factions on both sides soon threaten all-out war.Under Matt Reeves’ masterful direction, the film is an intense and exciting blockbuster with brains, and the special effects have been taken to another level.The majority of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is animated, but you just don’t think about it or notice. “Authentic” is the word that comes to mind, as it looks not only life-like, but the characters also have an emotional resonance with the audience.Also, the movie marks the first time that 3-D performance capture has been shot outside of a studio and it shows, adding a level of realism that many blockbusters fail to achieve.Andy Serkis, who plays Caesar, shows great depth as an actor. He asserts himself through the visual stylings of computer animation that completely transforms him into an animated ape.As a post-apocalyptic story of interspecies conflict, in which two tribes fight for their place in a new world, Dawn Of the Planet of the Apes proves itself as more than just a prelude to the main event. It is technically impressive and visually exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think and care about.
