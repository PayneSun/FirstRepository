Robot boxing: the battle of steel
Real Steel is many things: Rocky (1976) with robots that look like Transformers; a Cinderella Man (2005) comeback that’s complicated by the parent-child issues, with a sweet bit of the 2008 animation film Wall-E-styled scrap metal.Perhaps Reel Steal would be the better title.In the film, Charlie (Hugh Jackman) is an ex-boxer who is so deep in debt that he’s nearly out for the count. Reunited with the 11-year-old son he’s practically forgotten, Charlie promptly sells him to the boy’s aunt and uncle.Yet the boy won’t be sidelined so easily. He’s a fight fan himself, and he means to go on the road with his old man and more importantly with the robot Atom he rescues from scrap.In the film, robots have taken over from humans in the boxing ring. Computer effects pay off and give the heavy-metal robots some neat features. For example, Atom, the boxing robot, has pale blue bulbs for eyes beneath what looks like a fencing mask.In “shadow boxing mode” Atom mimics his coach’s movements with lightning speed. He can dance too – like a 1.8-meter, 3-ton butterfly.Robots aside, film director Shawn Levy doesn’t go in for futurism.The settings in the film give away a nostalgic feeling: a boxing gym that smacks of the 1920s, and Charlie’s truck looks like something out of a 1940s film. There are neon motel signs, back-country roads and an old Detroit auto plant rebuilt as a sports arena.As for the content, despite some mildly adult language and robot-on-robot violence, Real Steel is fundamentally about a son reconnecting with his dad.This topic might get corny, but the mix of old-fashioned heart and new fangled animatronics cyber tech makes this picture a winner for fathers and sons.Their father-son spats, truly some of the film’s best sparring, is what gives it heart. Not Rocky heart, or Raging Bull heart, mind you, but Real enough.In the end, Real Steel won’t win any prizes for innovation, but it works–it’s a technical knockout.
