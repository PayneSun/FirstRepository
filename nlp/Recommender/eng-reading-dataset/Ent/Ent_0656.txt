Men ditch tab by jumping off building
It was a dine-and-dash thrill for daredevils.After cocktails at one of Melbourne’s most prestigious restaurants, four men ditched the bill by parachuting off the building, the Herald Sun reported.The men leapt 55 stories from the Rialto Towers, after ordering a round of negronis at the exclusive Vue de monde restaurant last month.“Basically, four guys came upstairs with parachutes hidden underneath their jackets,” restaurant owner Shannon Bennett told the Herald Sun.Bennett explained how, one by one, the man left the bar to go to the restroom, where they changed outfits and then regrouped on the venue’s balcony.“I ran from the kitchen into the room and I just saw a flash of them jumping over, and at that stage none of us knew what the hell was going on,” he said.The four apparently climbed over a plastic barrier and jumped from the skyscraper, the second-tallest building in Melbourne, according to Australia’s 7News.The men, who were all dressed in business suits, reportedly had a getaway car waiting for them when they landed. Bennett told the Herald Sun he ran downstairs and tried to catch them.“I was just too late — they were really quick at what they were doing,” he said. “It was very well planned and they’ve obviously done this sort of stuff before.”7News notes that it’s not the first case of base jumping from the Rialto Towers.A former base jumper, Damian Hansen said he understands why the men did it, having made the same jump 24 years ago.“The feeling — it’s so exciting jumping off the Rialto,” he told 7News.“Police are trying to catch the men using surveillance video of the jump.
