Week of hot styles
Once again, the time has come for the biggest event in the fashion world: New York Fashion Week! But do you know enough about this annual event to call yourself a true fashionista?From seating arrangements to model behavior, here are some things you might not know about Fashion Week.Who gets a first-row seat?At Fashion Week, it’s where you sit that counts. A-list attendees include the fashion media, buyers, retailers, fashion professionals, celebrities and socialites, but who gets the coveted front-row seats comes down to the designers and their PR teams. Usually, it’s celebrities and important editors who get the best seats.Why do models always look so unhappy?Models usually parade along the runway with serious expressions on their faces. Well, it’s not that they’re too cool to smile. Most high fashion designers typically ask their models not to smile while walking down the runway. The idea is that audience members will concentrate on the fashion designs instead of the model’s face or personality. “It’s more than anything else about doing the job well,” supermodel Claudia Schiffer told Reuters.How should Fashion Week attendees behave?Designers appreciate it when attendees wear their brand to their show. Most design houses will even ensure that the celebrities are “appropriately” dressed in designer wear once they agree to attend.Catwalk photographers hate it when the audience’s feet sully their pristine runway shots, so just as the lights go down, they scream a single message to the audience: “Uncross your legs, please!”How do the Big Four fashion weeks differ?The Big Four always take place in this order: New York, London, Milan and Paris. Each of the Big Four is known for championing different styles — New York for sportswear; London for edgy, avant-garde design; Milan for its over-the-top yet stylish looks; and Paris for haute couture.
