Laowai writes Chinese hit
To Arseny Kaifel, a 23-year-old German national and student of Chinese at the University of International Business and Economics (UIBE) in Beijing, writing and recording a love song entirely in Chinese was simply a way to express the many beautiful memories he has built up over his time here –not a way to get famous.Yet after his 3.5-minute video, entitled "Beijing Love Song," was uploaded onto youku.com, it’s been viewed by nearly 900,000 visitors, many of whom expressed their admiration for the foreigner who sings his heart out.Performed by Kaifel’s band Feichang Fresh and shot in November, the video mentions many famous places in Beijing, including Houhai Lake and Workers’ Stadium, famous food including roasted Peking duck and Yanjing Beer, and such Beijing-dialect slang as bei’er liaobuqi (so amazing)."I’m full of excitement towards this city…Yangrouchuanr (lamb kebab) is my old companion…Peking Duck, let’s have one more piece…Yanjing Beer is the best/ My life here is pretty happy/ At Houhai, I have a lot of fun/ At the Beijing Workers Stadium we all feel so fly…I really can’t bear to leave," Kaifel sings enthusiastically."The lyrics express our true feeling about Beijing," Kaifel said, "It’s a place I’ve never gotten sick of – on the contrary, the longer we stay the newer and more exciting it gets."Sudden fameThe attention the song has received has been entirely unexpected, especially considering it was Feichang Fresh’s very first song and only took about one hour to write. "Beijing Love Song" has found its way onto Beijing TV’s Spring Festival Gala, Hunan TV’s Glee Sunday program and Let Dreams Fly, a youku.com-organized showcase."I never felt like this song would reach this level," he said. "We were practically joking around when writing it – maybe that’s why it sounds so relaxed and fun."Encouraged by their success, the band has since produced three other Chinese songs, all just as fun and cheeky as their first hit: "Shorty, Come Here (Meinü, Guolai)," "Little Cutie (Xiao Ke’ai)" and "Wish You Wealthy (Gongxi Facai)." All the songs were written by Kaifel and polished by his Chinese friends.Pathway to a careerSuch early success has inspired Kaifel to pursue a career as a music-video director and filmmaker, and he’s currently hard at work on a short film -- Crosswalk to Your Dreams (Mengxianglu Zhi Banmaxian), which tells a story about three young men, two Americans and one Chinese, who pursue their dreams of making music in Beijing, according to Kaifel.Born in Berlin, Germany to two musician parents, Kaifel said he was encouraged to branch out into other subjects so as to avoid the unsteady life of a musician. Choosing Chinese as his major at Free University of Berlin in 2008, he won a scholarship last summer to study at UIBE for one year, marking his fifth trip to China."The first time I came in 2006, I grew infatuated; the second time, I fell in love; now, I’m positively obsessed," he said. "Though my current scholarship is up in August, I’m sure I won’t be able to stay away for long."
