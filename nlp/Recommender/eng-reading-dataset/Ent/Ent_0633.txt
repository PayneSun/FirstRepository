Fairy tales return to darker origins
In the first minute of the trailer for Snow White & the Huntsman, evil queen Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron, strips naked, sucks the “youth” out of a teenage girl, and plots to rip Snow White’s heart from her chest.Given that most people think of Snow White as an innocent girl twirling through a forest, singing about someday her prince will come, this is less a trailer and more a statement of purpose: this story isn’t for children anymore.Snow White & The Huntsman, a bleak and brutal film with the tone close to Game of Thrones, is another fairytale film adaptation aimed at adults–after this year’s Mirror Mirror, last year’s Red Riding Hood, and dozens of other works in the past decade.According to The New York Times, they’re the latest trend “that’s undoing Disney’s 20th century work of transforming horrifying folk stories into genial animated musicals”.When Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs–the first feature-length cartoon by the company, it set a standard for the contemporary concept of the fairy tale: a whimsical, animated story appropriate enough for the entire family.However, while the new retellings may seem subversive, they’re actually throwbacks, marking a return to what these tales originally were.“Fairy tales can never be completely separated from their darker origins,” film critic Scott Meslow wrote for The Atlantic.“By contemporary standards, the Grimms’ original stories are packed with violence and sex.”For example, The Juniper Tree features a stepmother killing her stepson and serving him to his father in a stew, and Darling Roland features a mother-to-daughter axe murder.Meslow added that, if the audience has enough knowledge of the original stories to appreciate how they’re being adapted, twisted fairy tales, such as Snow White & the Huntsman, and TV shows like Grimm and Once Upon a Time, will work better.And it’s a knowledge that contemporary children are getting further and further away from, because they have grown up with more subversive fairy tales, such as Shrek series and Enchanted, than actual fairy tales.In many ways, the reverse-sanitization of the fairy tale is a return to the origins of stories that were, in their earliest forms, only “related at adult gatherings after children had been put to bed for the night”.As adults turn on an episode of Grimm after reading their children to sleep, or see Snow White & the Hunstman while their kids stay at home with a sitter, they’re embracing a concept of the fairy tale that predates even the Grimm Brothers–a trend appropriate enough for the oldest stories of all.
