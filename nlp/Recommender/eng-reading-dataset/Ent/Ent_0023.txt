Sharing her secret
Periods are sometimes called a “private monthly crisis” for females.But Chinese actress Yang Ying, better known by her stage name Angelababy, was brave enough to bring up the topic of periods on social media last month.She had been criticized for enjoying special treatment during her recent appearance on the second season of popular Chinese variety show Keep Running. In one episode, Angelababy only suffered a single water attack, while other celebrity contestants went through several.The 29-year-old actress responded to the criticisms by revealing that she didn’t feel well. “It was the first day of my period, and I was really uncomfortable,” she posted on Sina Weibo. “But I never said that I couldn’t go in the water. It really wasn’t fun sitting in that chair. I felt cold and frightened because you do not know what words or actions will trigger the water.”
