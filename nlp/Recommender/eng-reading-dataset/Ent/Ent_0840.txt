Han Han's magazine dies
Controversial blogger Han Han may have moved one step closer to becoming a full-time racecar driver again after staff at his magazine, Party, were let go Sunday, allowing him more time on the track.Ma Yimu, the executive editor in chief of the magazine, announced the dismissal Monday on his microblog, saying, "I cannot believe it. I am confident we’ll be back."Han’s assistant then confirmed the news with a text message.Han, 28, is one of the most popular Internet figures in China. His cheeky personal style, which flows throughout his books and blogs, as well as in real life, has helped him accumulate more than 306 million hits on his blog.He is a professional racecar driver and author. His magazine, whose Chinese name means "a chorus of solos," was first printed July 6, 15 months after Han started planning for the monthly publication.The 120-page Chinese-language magazine, priced at 16 yuan, included part of Han’s new novel, 1988 - I Want to Talk to the World, as well as essays, poems and opinion pieces from Hong Kong movie director Pang Ho-cheung, folk musician Zhou Yunpeng and blogger Luo Yonghao.Despite its successful debut, the maiden issue was the magazine’s only publication.Wang Zi, the author of "Chorus," an article published in the first issue, speculated that a lack of funds may have been the main reason for the move."There were so many staff members in the office, but the second issue continued to be put off. The failure to publish the magazine monthly meant daily operations were not sustainable," he said.Zhang Xiaobo, a well-known publisher who published China Can Say No, told the Global Times that although he may not agree with many of Han’s opinions, he felt sorry for the disappearance of the Party magazine, calling it a loss to China’s publishing industry.
