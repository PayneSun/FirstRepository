Artist paints the town
The Oscars – Hollywood’s biggest night – never needs introduction. People just watch it, or at least check out the winners list afterwards. The 84th Academy Awards, which ended last Sunday night, like any other previous ceremonies, has left us moments to remember – on stage and the red carpet. Let’s take a look at what has wowed us at this year’s Academy Awards.Octavia becomes tongue-tiedThe first emotional moment of the evening came with Octavia Spencer’s supporting actress win for her role as a tart-tongued maid in The Help.“Thank you Academy for putting me with the hottest guy in the room,” she joked, referring to the golden Oscar statuette.But then as she fought back tears and thanked her family, the tart-tongued became a little tongue-tied. “Please wrap up...I’m wrapping up. I’m sorry, I’m freaking out.”Streep scoops her third OscarMeryl Streep, who holds the record with 17 for the most Academy Award nominations, won the Oscar for the best lead actress for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. It’s her third Oscar and the first since winning for Sophie’s Choice in 1982.Accepting her award, the 62-year-old, who couldn’t hold back her tears, sounded less like a winning actress than a star who had just received a lifetime achievement award. “I look out there and I see my life before my eyes,” Streep said in her speech.Five Academy awards for silent tribute to HollywoodHollywood sure showed some love for its history. The Artist, a French film that has been called a love letter to old Hollywood, charmed Oscar voters and scooped up five awards, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.The film, which tells a romantic story of a fading star, has brought the Oscar the first French best actor, and it has also made a dog star, Uggie, who made an appearance onstage.By the way, did we mention that The Artist is made in the style of old silent and black and white film?
