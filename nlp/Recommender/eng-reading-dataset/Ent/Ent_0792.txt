New app plays Cupid
What would happen if you found out that the apple of your eye also has a secret fancy for you? How cool would be that…You may think that the odds on that happening are as slim as winning the lottery, and that happy endings only happen in romantic films.But now your chance of romance has been greatly increased. “Crush Notifier” functions have been launched on popular social networking sites including Renren.com and Chinese micro blog on Sina Weibo.Since Crush Notifier was launched earlier this year, more than 2 million people have used it, according to Cnr.cnRecently, the huge number of users and would-be users even crashed the service.An anonymous pair admitted that they’ve had a crush on each other for years, and could have missed out.How does the “love connection” work? Just log onto your accounts and add the application.Crush your friends without them knowing. But if they crush you back, you both get an e-mail of notification. Simple as that.Some users regard it as a blessing for those too shy or too tongue-tied to speak their love.Nonetheless, others say the idea of being stalked or monitored sounds creepy. And it’s better to keep love as vague and mysterious as possible.Pranksters and mischievous users “crush” their best friends. Romantics also send messages to their lovers or spouses.Worst of all is to turn a secret crush into a bold public confession by carelessly making a mistake entering your crush.In fact, the Crush Notifier was developed by the 24-year-old American app developer Dan Loewenherz. He designed it after his previous “Breakup Notifier” got banned on Facebook. With that breakup app, users select friends they want to monitor. Whenever the friend’s relationship status changes to “single” on Facebook, the app sends an e-mail. Is the crush app for you? Remember to practice before you send.
