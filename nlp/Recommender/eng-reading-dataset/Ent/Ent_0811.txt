Graduating couples snap wedding photos
Recently, landing a decent job is a difficult ordeal for graduating students to fulfill, one rendered all the more daunting by the equally tough task of saying goodbye to the ones they love.There are many reasons for student couples’ crack-ups, but most lay the blame on the age-old issue of different job opportunities in different places.For example, a graduating student surnamed Chen and her boyfriend are both from Wuhan-based Huazhong Normal University in Central China’s Hubei Province. However, since they are both tuition-free students, according to the regulations of their enrollment, they have to go back to their respective home provinces to teach after graduation.Chen and her boyfriend are not the only couple who suffer from the pain of departure, of course. In a sign of their devotion, some young lovers have come up with an idea to memorialize their affection, even though they have to make "farewell" to their beloved.Recording loveXiao Wei (pseudonym), a senior at a university in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, told the Global Times that she once believed that she and her boyfriend would be together forever; however, as graduation approaches, she is becoming doubtful.Forced to make a choice between boyfriend and her job, she chose the latter. According to her, it is so hard for graduating students to find a decent job that she doesn’t want to lose the working opportunity. Though her boyfriend was sympathetic to her decision, he too is torn by distress and feelings of loss."Although we can’t be together in the future, we want to record all our precious memories, so we decided to take wedding photos, which will remind us of all the good times we shared," said Xiao Wei.However, when asked about where will she keep these photos and what will she do if her would-be future husband finds them, Xiao Wei said that she never considered these issues; all she wanted was to record their love.Students’ opinionsAlthough taking wedding photos has become more popular in China, many students acknowledge it requires both money and courage."It is a good way to record love, but I don’t think I can afford more than 1,000 yuan  to take the photos," said Yuan Xiaolong, 22, a student at Shijiazhuang University of Economics in North China’s Hebei Province.Feng Tiantian, 22, a schoolmate of Yuan’s, said that it is a romantic idea in principle but she would be nervous to know what her future husband would think when seeing the photos several years down the line.Other students echo Feng’s comparatively conservative stance toward these potentially iconic images."I believe wedding photos are a part of the wedding process, which is a representation of marriage, and that only husbands and wives should take such photos," said Xu Tianzuo, 21, a student at Anhui University of Finance & Economics.However, Li Yinhe, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and one of China’s most prominent sociologists, said that it is not necessary to take the phenomenon too seriously."For these student couples, wedding photos are a souvenir of the old days. If they want to take the photos, others don’t have the right to say no," Li said.
