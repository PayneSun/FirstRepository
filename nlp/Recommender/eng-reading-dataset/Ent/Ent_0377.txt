Season essentials
There are always some trends that never seem to fade or get old in fashion. Stripes and camouflage prints are two typical examples. With various ways to wear them, they are gaining in popularity from catwalks to public streets this season.But to wear them well is not that easy. Here, we offer some tips and recommend a few pieces to help you catch up with these trends properly.Vertical stripesIf you carry most of your weight in the midsection, you belong to the apple figure. What you need are vertical stripes. They elongate and divert attention from your horizontal shape. If you are tall, but on the heavier side, choose thinner stripes. On the contrary, if you are thin, bolder stripes will make you look a bit bigger.Also, it would be best to stick with darker stripes, because contrasting colors add more depth.Horizontal stripesMuch like vertical stripes create an illusion of length, horizontal stripes can broaden the body. They are for slim women and make them look curvier, especially with bold, thick stripes. For example, wearing a shirt with a horizontal stripe across the chest or wrapping a thick belt around the hips are good choices.For men, bold horizontal stripes also help widen the upper body and create the desirable inverted triangle shape they usually yearn for.Diagonal stripesDiagonal stripes can be worn by most figure types, but are especially suitable for plus size women, as well as tall women with boyish figures. For thin women that want to look even thinner, diagonal stripes are the right choice. Askew diagonal stripes can add to a curvy look.The key to wearing this look is to think of the direction of the stripes to show off the best parts and hide the worst. For example, a skirt with the diagonal stripes coming in at the middle and pointing up to the waist will work to make your waistline look smaller.
