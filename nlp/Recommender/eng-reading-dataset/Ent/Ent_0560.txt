Romeo Beckham launches his modelling career
With parents as high-profile and successful as David and Victoria Beckham, it’s no surprise that Romeo is already on the road to world domination.The 10-year-old has been unveiled as the newest star of Burberry’s Spring/Summer 2013 campaign, making his modelling debut alongside Edie Campbell and Cara Delevingne.Following his mother into the fashion world, the youngster was hand-picked by the British label’s Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, for his first big break.He might not even be in his teens yet, but according to Bailey, Romeo ’stole she show’ during the photoshoot, despite it being his first professional job.Wearing a classic beige Burberry trench coat and clutching one of the label’s well-known umbrellas, the young Beckham boy adopted a number of poses during the shoot.In a style that’s often seen on his famous footballer dad, the rising star wore a tailored suit and tie, complete with shiny black shoes.Looking old beyond his years, but still exuding a youthful playfulness, the youngster wore the collar of his coat turned up and gave the camera a wide, toothy grin.While some debated whether the schoolboy might follow his father in the world of football, Romeo has made it clear that he’s a mummy’s boy and has clearly taken her fashion industry advice to heart.In the campaign, shot by world famous photographer Mario Testino, the young model poses alongside Edie and Charlie France, who wear matching coats.’This season’s campaign lights up with the infectious energy of an amazing young cast of old and new Burberry family,’ said Bailey.’We had such fun shooting the campaign and I think that comes through in the images, which really reflect the upbeat spirit of the collection,’ he added.The young Beckham, who has clearly started at the top for his first modelling job, seems set to become a key player in the fashion industry, just like his mother.
