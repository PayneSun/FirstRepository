Evans moves on
US actor Chris Evans will probably always be associated with the character of Captain America.But the 36-year-old is ready to hang up his shield and call it a day. On March 22, Evans announced that he would leave the Marvel Universe after the release of Avengers 4, which is due to come out next year. His latest work, Avengers: Infinity War, arrives in theaters on May 4 in the United States.“I’d be lying if I said it [won’t] be hard for me,” he told USA Today. “But the passing of time and the passing of torches is part of the experience. Nothing lasts forever. There’s a beauty in that departure, even if it can be sad at times. It’s also joyful.”The daily intense workouts that were required to fit into the tight costume may be a reason why Evans decided to quit the role. “When you’re creeping on 36, working out is a little bit harder,” he told USA Today. “I’m just going to get fat. [I have] potato chips and ice cream before bed.”
