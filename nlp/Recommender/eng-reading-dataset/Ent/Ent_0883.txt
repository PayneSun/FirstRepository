It's a fashion emergency
British rapper M.I.A. was caught wearing sweat socks and metallic gold sandals last month. She was trying to follow this summer’s socks-and-sandals trend, promoted by top fashion houses, including Burberry and Prada. Unfortunately, somebody called the fashion police because M.I.A.’s socks-and-sandals combo was tragic – not trendy.Along with socks-and-sandals combos, gladiator shoes and jumpsuits are also trendy this season. But, I have to say, these chic items don’t necessarily promise good fashion. When you get it wrong, they can turn you into a walking fashion disaster. Here, the 21st Century fashion police spot the latest fashion victims and discuss how they can get it right.jumpsuit/romperA head-to-toe all-floral jumpsuit? Stay away from it, unless you want to look like a walking garden. Keep the 80s where they belong – in the past. Make this look modern by choosing solid colors and sophisticated fabrics. If, however, you’re a big fan of floral patterns, try short jumpsuits, also known as rompers, for a sweet look.socks-and-sandals comboM.I.A.’s mistake is a perfect occasion for a fashion public service announcement: Please, please don’t combine sweat socks with sandals. The truth is, the socks-and-sandals combo is really difficult for us mere morals to pull off. This risky trend was still a fashion crime last year. But if you’re going to brave it, consider selecting a sock in a matching or near-matching color to your sandal for a more seamless look.gladiator shoes/ gladiator sandalAnkle-high gladiator shoes with a calf-length dress is definitely a no-no. A dress of that length will cut your height. A pair of ankle-high gladiator shoes will cut the length of your legs. What’s left? A few inches of your skin making you look way shorter. Instead of a long dress, you need a mini-skirt or a pair of cuffed shorts to match with the gladiator shoes.
