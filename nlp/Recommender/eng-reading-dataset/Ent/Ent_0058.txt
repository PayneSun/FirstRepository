China’s new hero
It’s rare that the protagonist in a Chinese movie wins the audience’s hearts with an emotionally uplifting message, rather than by showing off his or her good looks. But Wolf Warrior II is putting China in the global spotlight. It’s also the first film to taste success both in terms of box office earnings and promoting Chinese values.Kung fu artist Wu Jing both starred in and directed the action movie. Since its release on July 27, it’s earned an unimaginable 4.5 billion yuan, setting a record for domestic movies at the box office.The film focuses on a rescue operation in Africa, led by former special forces soldier Leng Feng – played by Wu. Leng helps Chinese workers and local Africans flee a war-torn and plague-ravaged country.Wolf Warrior II links art to reality, and reminds people of the massive evacuation of Chinese people from Libya when civil war broke out there in 2011, and from Yemen in 2015, as well as the challenges the Ebola virus created in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.The film describes how the Chinese government aims to protect overseas Chinese citizens. Just as the message at the end of the film reads: “Citizens of the People’s Republic of China. When you encounter danger in a foreign land, do not give up! Please remember, at your back stands a strong motherland.”Thanks to China’s increasing participation in global affairs, now could be considered the right moment to introduce a modern Chinese hero.“Holding up a banner of peace, friendship and responsibility, Wolf Warrior II should be seen as a brave effort to promote Chinese values around the world,” columnist Zhu Ping wrote in China Daily.“It’s time Chinese filmmakers produced films that tell good stories and carry the right spirit. Let us assume Wolf Warrior II has started that trend.”
