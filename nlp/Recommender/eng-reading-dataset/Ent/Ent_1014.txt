His passion brings many hearts
XIAO Yao, a 20-year-old Tsinghua University student, has touched the hearts of hundreds of people with his own sweet version of The Cascades’ Rhythm of the Rain.Xiao had uploaded his version of the song to the Gekuang.i21st.cn site, for a foreign language singing competition held by 21st Century. Xiao ranked No 1 in the English section by winning the votes of 1,203 viewers."Because of the sweet voice, I couldn’t help searching for this person online," one of Xiao’s fans blogged. One look at his Xiaonei.com profile and the photo there and you know he’s made to be an idol: Tsinghua basketball team member, a handsome face, and both French and Spanish added to his English.But Xiao says that singing and basketball are just a small part of his life. He sees himself as rather a simple, persistent person looking for pure, enduring love.He’s had a crush on a classmate at Tsinghua, "a kind-hearted, elegant girl who needs to be taken care of". It was she who told him about the competition and encouraged him to go for it. The Cascades’ song somehow came to him when he was pursuing the girl but getting no response."I didn’t expect that I could meet a lot of friends who shared the interest in English and singing in the competition," Xiao says. But the most important thing he got from the competition, he thinks, is the classmate he has a crush for. Her words of excitement and praise were the biggest reward, Xiao says.His new hobby is now debate and he hopes that he can impress the girl with his skills there, just as he did with his singing."She loves debate and is good at it. I first met her at a debate contest. It will be great if we share the same hobby!" Xiao says, showing how eager he is.Perhaps it’s his innocent passion and sincere love that make his songs come alive and win hundreds of hearts.
