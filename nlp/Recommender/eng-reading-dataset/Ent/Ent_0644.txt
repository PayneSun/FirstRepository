Women who think like men
Move over, The Hunger Games. For the last two weeks, the US box office has welcomed a new winner – Think Like a Man.The contemporary romantic comedy, which is an adaptation of US comedian/author Steve Harvey’s advice book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, depicts the age-old battle of the sexes with some fresh ground rules and good-looking characters.“Even in Los Angeles, where the movie is set, you’d be hard-pressed to find so many gorgeous men and women hanging out together,” Michael Phillips, movie critic for the Los Angeles Times, wrote. “Let alone complaining that they can’t find love.”All of the characters in the film are bonded by a common interest: Harvey’s bestselling romance guide, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man.Single mom Candace falls for a mama’s boy Michael. Mya won’t allow Zeke into her bedroom for 90 days. Kristen wants longtime boyfriend Jeremy to propose. And status conscious Lauren needs to decide if she’s willing to date a broke chef.All of these women turn to Harvey’s book for advice, which works up to the point when the men figure out what they’re up to and start reading the book themselves.Will the women figure out that the men are creating fake versions of themselves to please their women? Or will the men discover that they actually want to live up to their Harvey-inspired phony personae?The movie offers a lot of conversations about the mechanics of dating, or the issue of conflict between the genders–the verbal jokes are often unexpected and witty.And the cast is uniformly engaging and charismatic that they make the whole thing work.One thing that makes the film seem less smart is that, as the characters in the movie keep talking about Harvey and his book, it may look like an infomercial for the book.Still, Think Like a Man winds up being a good story that you can relate to, if you don’t mind enduring that aspect. As Harvey says in his book: “Sometimes, it pays to compromise.”
