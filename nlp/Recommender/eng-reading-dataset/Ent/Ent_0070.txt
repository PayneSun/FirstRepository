Hit Netflix show teaches life lesson
One afternoon, US high school boy Clay Jensen receives a mysterious package with no return address. When he opens it, he is shocked to find seven audio tapes which have been recorded by Hannah Baker, his classmate who had killed herself two weeks earlier. Clay had secretly been in love with her but never had the courage to tell her about it.On the tapes, Hannah has stated 13 reasons for ending her own life and Clay is one of the reasons. Hannah even left him a map marking places with dotsfor him to visit.Clay walks out of his home and with her voice in his ear, he travels all over town trying to find out the reasons why she felt her life had to end so tragically.Through Hannah and Clay’s narratives, US author Jay Asher tells a sad story of confusion and desperation in novel Thirteen Reasons Why. The story stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for eight weeks when it was published in 2007. And now, it has been made into a web TV series by US entertainment company Netflix, with the name 13 Reasons Why.As Clay anxiously awaits to find out how he played a part in her suicide, he can’t help but notice how a number of little, seemingly unimportant events can add up to a terrible high school existence for someone else.It reminds us all that sometimes when something is said or done to hurt someone else, it can have lasting effects and can even lead to other major events in that person’s life.The theme of the story is that we are all responsible for our own actions. Hannah never denies it was her choice to end her life. However, there were many times when someone could have acted differently that may have changed her decision.Even though it is a fictional story, many of us will identify with at least parts of Hannah’s high school life and may even know someone showing warning signs for suicide. And hopefully, we can act and prevent such a tragedy.
