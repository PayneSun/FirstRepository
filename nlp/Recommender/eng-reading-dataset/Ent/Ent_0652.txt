Movie goes down well
Fifteen years after James Cameron’s Titanic sailed – and didn’t sink at the box office – the film returns in another dimension. The director, who set the standard for 3-D cinema with Avatar, retrofitted his old-Hollywood romance for a second voyage.“Are you ready to go back to Titanic?”Prepare to hear that famous line repeatedly as Titanic, the 1997 epic romance, is relaunched into theaters on April 10–complete with a 3-D makeover.And the second-highest-grossing film of all time, with $600.8 million (about 3.8 billion yuan) in the US–runner-up to another title directed by James Cameron, 2009’s Avatar ($760.5 million)–is about to make a valiant go at reclaiming the top spot.Based on the true story of the grand ship’s destruction during its maiden trip in 1912, with fictional tales intertwined, The New York Times says Titanic is “the most meticulously rendered and relentless disaster movie ever made”.This time, the story remains the same, but the dizzying visuals are even more spectacular. Unlike many 3-D films that have a dark, muddy quality, Titanic’s images are sharper and the ship’s nearly vertical inundation and breaking in two after striking an iceberg are all the more gut-wrenching.The sentimental shipboard romance between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) famously inspired repeat viewings by young women. This time around it’s the sea water slamming through corridors that will likely sell tickets.The contrasting images of desperately trapped steerage passengers and moneyed folks clinging to once-burnished balustrades are more impressive with the enhanced technology.The ship looks all the more sumptuous with the added dimension. The scene where Jack rescues Rose from jumping overboard comes off as more dangerous and intimately revealing in 3-D.Three dimensions enhance the drama of a rupturing hull and the horror of people sliding helplessly across the massive deck, falling into the ocean or trying to climb on the lifeboats.“If there’s only one movie on earth that needed to be in 3-D, it’s probably Titanic,” Entertainment Weekly’s movie critic Owen Glerberman wrote. “It was always a spectacular popping-off-the-screen experience. And 15 years later, it still is.”
