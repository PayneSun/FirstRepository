If zombies invade...
Zombie apocalypses. Robot revolutions. These may seem like impossibilities, but many people prepare for these events on a daily basis.In the West, groups have been formed to spread awareness and share tips on surviving scenarios such as societal breakdown brought upon by zombies or computers.Humans United Against Robots (HUAR) and the Zombie Preparedness Initiative (ZPI) build on these irrational fears, supplying information and networking for believers and jokers alike.“Computer programs can identify human speech and match it to computerized dictionaries in order to understand our weaknesses,” says a statement on HUAR’s website.“Jokester scientists build robots which can breathe fire and shoot lasers from their eyes. It is evident a task force had to be formed of members who take being at the top of the food chain seriously.”Preparation for survival doesn’t come cheap. Patrick Geryl, author of How to Survive 2012 told the CNN he has already spent over $130,000 (820,732 yuan).There are other rules too. For example, survival kit should be lightweight, but contain all the essentials: food, water, clothes, and of course, weapons.For zombies fire and guns with a good range are the critics’ pick. When dealing with a robot invasion, tools like pliers and wire cutters are more prized.ZPI focuses on providing a forum for survival techniques and advice on everything from how to find clean water, to how to skin a moose.While I might be tempted to wonder at how useful these tips might be, only time will tell.If the Zombie Apocalypse comes today, you might be glad you looked at their website. It might help you stay alive.
