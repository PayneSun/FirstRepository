Back to comics’ darkest city
It’s the same Gotham with the same familiar characters: Bruce Wayne, “cat” Selina Kyle, “Penguin” Oswald Cobblepot… The only significant difference is there is no Batman.So here comes the question: Who can fight against criminals and corruption and keep justice alive in the city?In Fox’s crime TV series Gotham, which premiered on Sept 22, rookie detective James Gordon takes on the responsibility.The story begins when Gordon, paired with veteran Harvey Bullock, is assigned to investigate the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne. At the crime scene, Gordon met the victims’ son, Bruce Wayne, who as we all know will later become “the Dark Knight”.The case was soon closed when Mario Pepper (the “main suspect” of the Waynes’ death) was paroled but shot.However, Gordon later finds out the situation is much more complex than it seems. Gordon confessed the truth to young Bruce Wayne and promised him that he would track down the real murderer sooner or later.Though the detective duo solves seemingly individual cases in each episode, many things we know from the Batman comics and movies have yet to happen.With the story’s beginning and ending already written, we’re left to wonder how Bruce Wayne matures physically and mentally into eventually becoming the Batman. When and how will Catwoman meet Wayne and form her complicated love-hate relationship with him? There’s much to explore in later episodes.As a prequel to the Dark Knight trilogy, there may be fans who wonder how Gotham can be a true Batman series without the superhero. But the show’s creator clearly wants the focus to remain on how average people deal with heinous criminal activity.“It’s as much about the hope and the struggle that they’re engaged in as waiting for a savior,” executive producer Bruno Heller said when he met with TV critics in July. “It’s about men and women, not about superheroes, and to me that’s the more interesting story.”
