When it comes to fashion, most men could care less. Shopping? Same thing. Makeup? Not interested. But when it comes to how sexy a woman looks when she’s all done up or just chilling in her sweatpants, men are all ears, or eyes we should say—they’re visual creatures, what do you expect? They don’t care about the hottest new fashion trends or how much a tank topcosts (well, sort of), as long as it looks good on a woman and hugs her curvesin all the right places, it’s good enough for them. Common though, where’s the fun in that? Men have to have a look they love on a gal, right? Here’s what we concluded after careful consideration:1.
