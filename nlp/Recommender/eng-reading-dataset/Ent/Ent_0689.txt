Can you look cool in these?
As the temperature drops dramatically, the battle between fashion and pragmatism now revolves around whether to wear long johns.South Korea President Lee Myung-bak last month called on his people to “wear long johns to save energy” in his biweekly radio address.“I have recently lowered the thermostat in the place I work. Naturally, I had to wear long johns which were uncomfortable initially. But after a while, I got used to them, and now I am very comfortable wearing them,” said Lee.Sure long johns do a good job keeping people warm. But for many people, they have been something for grandparents, or rather, they are a fashion no-no.In 2008, Su Mang, chief editor of the Chinese version of fashion magazine Bazaar indicated that wearing long johns compromised fashion.“I never allow people around me to wear long johns,” Su said in a talk show with TV anchor Chen Luyu.But things seem to be different for long johns ever since last year.A number of important designer labels, including Jean Paul Gaultier, D & G and Dries Van Noten, all showed variations of long johns on their 2010/2011 fall/winter runways.And British actor Jude Law even sported a pair of long johns at a London airport earlier last year, together with a loosely structured jacket and T-shirt, which made a lot of jaws drop.“It’s a very British thing,” explained British designer Victoria Barlett to The New York Times.Long johns were first made popular in the 19th century by the English company John Smedley which still produces them today.But Jude Law is not the only celebrity heartthrob that loves the garments. British soccer star David Beckham is another big fan.“They are very cool,” Beckham told UK newspaper The Sun in September.What’s more, Beckham has pledged to put the sexy back into long johns. He is designing his own line of long johns which will hit stores in February 2012 just in time for Valentine’s Day.If anyone can make long johns sexy, Beckham could be the man to do it.
