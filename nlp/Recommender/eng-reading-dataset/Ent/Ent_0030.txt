Westworld star survives
Evan Rachel Wood is no stranger to acting – she started to perform at her father’s theater when she was only 3 years old. But even being involved in show business for so many years, the 30-year-old US actress still feels pressure from time to time.When she played the role of Dolores Abernathy, a robot in the HBO TV series Westworld, Wood’s secret weapon to boost her energy was listening to the classic song I Will Survive by US singer Gloria Gaynor. The second season of the hit show returned on April 22.The science fiction series became a breakout success after being aired in 2016. “HBO warned me, ‘You know, your life’s probably going to change after this,’” Wood told Rolling Stone magazine.The role won her a Critics’ Choice award and nominations for Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. “I couldn’t handle all the attention when I was younger, but now I feel like I’m in a place where I’m not going to collapse under the pressure.”
