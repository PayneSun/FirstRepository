Magical transformations
Movie magic can defy reality, but actors are inescapably human. They grow and change, and don’t necessarily change for the better.Harry Potter actors, who are now saying their final goodbyes to their roles, have all become fully-fledged grown-ups, worlds apart from the little kids who began the Hogwarts’ adventures in 2001.While many fans feel sad that the magical franchise is coming to an end, some feel even sadder to see how much the actors have changed over the years.“Daniel Radcliffe (who plays Harry Potter) went from being a really cute kid to a thin, pale-looking guy,” said Filipino Internet User lealuvy2j, 26. “I kind of wish he stayed a kid forever.”Radcliffe himself doesn’t seem to be bothered by his change of appearance. In an interview with GQ magazine last week, he teased himself: “If people find me sexy or cool, it’s because they like short, little, nerdy guys. And we do have our niche.”Meanwhile, actors growing up to be handsome have their headaches.Harry Melling, who played Potter’s cousin Dudley Dursley, told The Telegraph that he was almost recast for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows when producers discovered he’d lost a lot of weight he had as a kid. He was too thin for the part.“They (the producers) did this double take, ‘Oh my God, we are going to have to do something,’ and I felt guilty,” said Melling.Aside from changes in looks, the gradual personality change of child stars is another big concern of audience and producers.Miley Cyrus began her career at 13 in Disney’s hit TV series Hannah Montana.When Cyrus decided to show her adult personality by releasing “sexy” photos, people began to get uneasy about her.Reports had it that furious Disney bosses were considering replacing Cyrus with a more clean-cut teen star.Cyrus finally kept her role after public apologies. But some parents banned their children watching the show. “My daughter has been banned from watching the show,” supermodel Cindy Crawford told ShowbizSpy. “I really don’t think Miley Cyrus is much of a role model for my kid.”
