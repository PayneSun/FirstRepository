Sequel to classic worth wait
For fans of the 1982 film Blade Runner, the wait for a sequel might have meant a mixed feeling of high hopes and dread. The original film, directed by legendary UK director Ridley Scott, is set in the future world of 2019 in Los Angeles, where human policemen are sent out to kill “replicants” – robots created for labor.It’s long been seen as a sci-fi classic, due to its futuristic setting and the fact that it still raises troubling questions about technology and humanity. In every way, 1982’s Blade Runner was ahead of its time, and a film that’s very hard to compete with.Thirty-five years later, the Canadian director Denis Villeneuve completed the task of making the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, which was released on Oct 27.And luckily for fans of the original, it was worth the long wait.Set in 2049, 30 years after the original story, replicants are still being hunted, but this time by their own kind. Police officer K – played by US actor Ryan Gosling – belongs to a newer generation of replicants and is sent to destroy the older models. But as he finds out more about his own past during his mission, he starts questioning the meaning of his job and his existence.Even three decades later, the theme of “human vs machine” is still relevant, especially with artificial intelligence being brought to reality in today’s world. Indeed, the question still remains: What makes us human?According to Blade Runner 2049, the line between human and machine is still as unclear as it was in 1982.K, a replicant and “without a soul”, as he says himself, is fully capable of feeling emotions and choosing to do the right thing. And Joi, K’s virtual girlfriend, also shows that she cares deeply for K – even though she doesn’t have a body. It’s probably safe to say that she’s even more human-like than K’s human boss, Lieutenant Joshi, who is cold and merciless.In this sense, despite the fact that Blade Runner 2049 hasn’t been as popular at the box office as was expected, it’s still “the rare sequel that can hold its own next to a bona fide masterpiece”,wrote Rafer Guzman, reporter for Newsday.
