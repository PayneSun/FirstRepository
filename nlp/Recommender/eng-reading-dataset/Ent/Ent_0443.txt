Thor strikes another winner
The events in The Avengers had a big impact on Thor’s home planet Asgard: Loki is consigned to life in prison, Thor has finally given up on him, and Odin is more impatient than ever with Thor’s attachment to Earth and, more specifically, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman).With the memory of the alien invasion in New York still fresh in their minds, the avengers are seeking out trouble separately until the next incident that threatens the extinction of the Earth.So Thor, the mighty god who calls up thunderstorms with a big hammer, returns to Asgard, only to find that an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith is planning to plunge the universe back into darkness.Faced with an enemy that even Odin, Thor’s father, and Asgard cannot defeat, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet; one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save the cosmos.Operating on a grander scale and with more humor than its predecessor, Thor: The Dark World has as much swagger as its title character and is among Marvel’s most confident offerings to date.With rival brothers Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) forced to work together and hash out their issues mid-battle, there’s a rock solid emotional foundation that offsets the jokes, although the two aren’t always smoothly integrated.Germain Lussier, movie critic of Film magazine, speaks highly of the movie in terms of bringing characters alive with big action: “So Thor: The Dark World hits the ground running with fully realized, charismatic and confident portrayals of all the characters involved. It’s defined by Thor being an ultimate hero and Loki being a mischievous villain.“That, coupled with plenty of Avengers-size action, laugh-out-loud humor and Marvel Cinematic Universe Easter eggs help make the movie one of the best Marvel films to date.”For Erik Davis, of Movies.com, the movie’s action sequences are “inventive, its characters are wicked and relatable”.“There’s so much wild scenery to chew on that if you’re any kind of fan of comic books and comic book movies, you’ll leave the theater with a big smile on your face,” he said.According to Digital Spy, another highlight of the movie is Hiddleston, who plays Loki in the movie: “Chris Hemsworth is on charismatic, physically imposing form once again as the hammer-wielding hero, but the film belongs to Hiddleston, which is all the more remarkable given how much of its running time he spends off screen. Additional scenes were filmed to flesh out Loki’s storyline, and watching the final cut you only wish they’d gone further.”Despite its occasionally bipolar quality, Thor: The Dark World is a hugely entertaining and well-written continuation of Marvel’s Phase 2, combining heart, spectacle and a clever lightness of touch.
