Time traveling photographer
Genius. Photographer Chino Otsuka has discovered the art of time travel. Instead of exploiting a whole in the Space-time continuum to time travel, she simply digitally spliced her adult self into old photographs from her childhood. That way it looked like adult version of Otsuka was meeting child version of Otsuka. So clever.Otsuka explains the thought process behind her excellent photo series Imagine Finding Me:"The digital process becomes a tool, almost like a time machine, as I’m embarking on the journey to where I once belonged and at the same time becoming a tourist in my own history."Sometimes she mimics what she did as a kid, other times she’s simply crossing paths with her childhood self and there’s even a few pictures where it looks like she’s taking care of her childhood self. It’s clever photo manipulation but a few of these shots really make it look like she was there the entire time.In Subway StationIn the BedroomAt the BeachWith a SnowmanOn the Bench
