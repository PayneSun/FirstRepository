Emotional rollercoaster of a movie
Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They fall in love. Then something bad happens, which tears them apart. However, after things cool down, they’re back together and live happily ever after.That’s what a standard love story has to offer. And that’s also what the film First Time is determined to challenge.Starring popular young idols Angelababy and Mark Chao, the film takes the audience back to school and guarantees a pure, romantic love story between the two.College student Song Shiqiao (Angelababy), who discovers she has a terminal illness, meets her old high school crush, Gong Ning (Chao). Of course, they fall hopelessly in love.Sounds like a cliché, right? However, director Han Yan promises that the film has more to offer. Soon enough, you’ll find that, instead of the “young love” *tag, *suspense becomes the key to the film.Gong’s sudden return to Song’s life changes everything. But there’s a background story. Gong died long ago, and Song’s mother finds a *substitute to *impersonate Gong, in order to fulfill her daughter’s dying wish.If you think that’s it–it’s not done yet. Song finds out quickly about her mother’s *setup and instead of uncovering the whole thing, she goes with it.Yes, while the two enjoy their “first time” romance, it might be the first time for the audience to experience such emotional ups and downs in less than two hours.And regardless of truth, or lies, in the end, the film wants to *portray nothing but love: the innocent and unforgettable first love, a mother’s great and selfless love, and something false which becomes true love.“After watching the film, you’ll find the title First Time doesn’t have to mean the first love,” Director Han told Sina.com.“It can be explained as the first time to really fall in love, *recklessly, bravely and even forgetting yourself. And I think that’s something more powerful than love itself.”
