Off to a mysterious start
The names of Steven Spielberg and Halle Berry alone would make Extant, CBS’ new summer sci-fi drama, a must-watch. Their latest collaboration proves not only the magic of the talented duo, but also shows how delicate and inventive a summer series can be.The Spielberg-produced series begins when astronaut Molly Woods (Halle Berry) returns home after a 13-month-long solo mission in space. While she’s struggling to fit back in with her family — scientist husband John and their “son” Ethan, an artificial intelligence robot created by John — Woods’ doctor drops a bomb: she’s pregnant.The show’s high-concept mystery at its center is quite intriguing, but judging by an early look at things after three episodes (the series premiered on July 9), what drives Extant isn’t the who’s-the-daddy mystery, but the show’s ideas.First, it establishes with several quick cues that you’re looking at the future: driverless cars, bathroom mirrors that turn into television screens at a touch, and garbage cans that compact trash elegantly.Extant also combines a lot of sci-fi premises we’ve seen before. For example, Woods’ predicament, explored through flashbacks to her lonely time working in space, is reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), with a touch of Gravity (2013) thrown in. There’s also the corporate conspiracy that recalls Alien (1979), and the series’ main plot is straight from Spielberg’s A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).Those ideas may not be new, but the creators deserve credit for trying to revive this kind of classic sci-fi mystery, which it is hard to find new ideas for.It’s way too soon to say whether the show will work out, but it’s promising that the early episodes seem confident enough to play it cool and create an atmosphere, rather than directly giving audiences many “wow” moments.Despite starring an Oscar-winning actress, the first three episodes don’t offer many shining moments for Berry, whose performance is reserved and quiet. But of course, Berry’s star quality is enough to keep us riveted and waiting for whatever twist comes next.In the end, Extant may be going where many other sci-fi stories have gone before, but for a summer network drama, it’s at least trying to take a slightly different path. It certainly has the potential to be extant throughout the hot months.
