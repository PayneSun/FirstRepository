Lang values UNICEF ambassador role
He is not just a classical music superstar. He is a global superstar. Only 27 years old, the Chinese pianist Lang Lang has become an inspiration to tens of millions around the world.Among his dazzling long list of titles, Lang considered UNICEF goodwill ambassador the most special one."Being a UNICEF goodwill ambassador is the best decision I have made and will definitely be the best experience in my life," Lang said in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua at the UN headquarters in New York."I love children very much, and playing piano for them is my favorite," Lang said, beaming with delight. Named this year by Time magazine as one of the 100 World’s Most Influential People, the pianist said he hoped music could "bring children happiness and enlighten their life."Three months after his nomination in 2004, Lang went to Tanzania with the UNICEF team to visit children threatened by malaria and AIDS.Although the southeastern African country’s underdevelopment and harsh living conditions surprised Lang who landed the continent for the first time, he was touched by local children’s passion for music."Most of the kids had never seen a piano before," Lang said. "When I played Chopin’s nocturne or waltz to them, those who were too shy to talk to me suddenly became active and began to share with me about their dreams. How amazing it is!" "Music can bring hopes to the kids and open their mind," he said.Following his visit to Africa, Lang began to organize fundraising concerts for children. Now it has become his routine to do 15 to 20 fundraising concerts every year."The most successful one was the first that was held in Houston, Texas in 2005, during which we received more than US$20 million," Lang recalled, "the number exceeded all our expectations.""I know it is hard to surpass, but I will keep doing these for children," Lang said with a firm voice, adding that he was going to South Africa in June 2010 for his second Africa visit.Except for his efforts on fundraising, Lang also established his own international music foundation last year to assist young talents to play piano.So far Lang has chosen five children from the United States and Germany, providing them with scholarships and opportunities to perform at world-class music halls, he said.In December, he will start the selection in China where he would like to "focus more on physically challenged kids, like blind kids."
