Return of the Ninja Turtles
My excitement before watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the latest reboot for the 1980s’ comic series, brought back the feeling of when I was a kid, waiting in front of the TV every day after school for a 20-minute episode.Compared with other popular cartoons from my childhood, the idea of four turtle brothers with a pizza addiction living in the sewer wasn’t nearly as cool as, say, the Transformers fighting to save the planet.But the Ninja Turtles were weirdly unique, and the crime-fighting chelonians known as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael have proven themselves to be surprisingly resilient over the years. They’ve starred in four separate TV series (in 1987, 1997, 2003 and 2012), a 1990 live-action movie, and an animated feature in 2007.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opens with an engaging, animated prologue that recalls how our four half-shelled heroes were birthed from a lab experiment before taking up secret residence in the tunnels of the New York sewer system. Years later, New York faces a threat in the form of ruthless villain Shredder and his menacing Foot Clan.The cameras then turn to Megan Fox, who as television news reporter April O’Neil desperately tries to convince her incredulous boss she’s got proof of vigilantes battling Shredder’s troops.Despite the nostalgic storyline, director Jonathan Liebesman (Battle Los Angeles) gives the four heroes a modern gloss. And thanks to his technical treatment, the turtles’ movements look highly realistic.As an action movie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is loaded with inventive touches during big action sequences, including one chase down the side of a snowy mountain involving our turtles, April and a bunch of jeeps, which is quite different from the usual car chase or rooftop battle scene featured in most other action flicks.The movie also features the distinguishable traits of a Michael Bay (Transformers) production. Like the Transformers series, the characters in the film are actually supporting roles to a human character, Megan Fox’s April. And of course, humor comes in the form of heavy pop-culture references.These were all well-calculated decisions, actually. Kids love the animated turtles. Teenagers can appreciate the mixture of straight action with wisecracks, not to mention the presence of the alluring Fox.Add in flashes of nostalgia for adults such as myself, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles appeals to a wide demographic. I’m already looking forward to the next two installments in the trilogy.
