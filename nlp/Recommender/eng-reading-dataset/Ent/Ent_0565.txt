Historic saga eyes foreign market
Feng Xiaogang is perhaps China’s most clever commercial movie director. He hasn’t directed one movie that failed to make a handsome profit in recent years, including Assembly in 2007, If You Are the One in 2008 and Aftershock in 2010.For some, Feng may be too commercial at times – product placement in his movies is often conspicuous and has even become a laughing stock.But with his new epic Back to 1942, Feng might avoid such criticism.Based on a novel by Liu Zhenyun, Back to 1942 tells the true story of the devastating Henan province famine that claimed more than 3 million lives in 1942, a time when China was engaged in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945).This historic background provides the perfect material to create a blockbuster movie. And Feng is no stranger to using exciting elements, such as devastating natural disasters (as seen in Aftershock) and thrilling battle scenes (as seen in Assembly).Combined with a strong cast, which includes Xu Fan, Zhang Guoli, Chen Daoming and Zhang Hanyu, it is almost certain that these elements will ensure the movie becomes a major box office hit, at least in China.But this time, Feng seems to have set his eyes on the international market as well. Joining the strong Chinese cast are two big names from Hollywood: Tim Robbins (who plays a Catholic priest) and Adrien Brody (who plays American journalist Theodore White).Many of the movie’s scenes, like the ones showing the bombing attacks by the Japanese army, are very Hollywood-style, both in terms of their scale and technical level.But somehow, despite the cast mostly bearing up to the challenge of delivering their roles, the movie, like many of its kind, such as White Deer Plain, falls short on generating an emotional impact. It seems to confirm the old saying “one man dying is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic figure”.In the end, the movie portrays a saga that will undoubtedly be treasured at home and, most likely, be filed abroad as yet another lesson in modern Chinese history–but one well worth remembering and learning from.
