‘Queen B’ reigns
When Beyonce Knowles dropped her self-titled album without any warning back in December, I was amazed, like the rest of the world. I was also curious to see how she’d outdo herself after an obvious career peak.Now almost nine months have passed, and the facts speak for themselves: 132 performances in 28 countries during her Mrs Carter Show world tour; 21 performances during the On the Run tour with her husband Jay Z, which, according to Forbes, should net the couple $100 million (about 615 million yuan); and several new remixes of cuts from her surprise album, with guest stars including Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.In her latest career surprise, on Aug 24 Beyonce received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards, a special honor in one of the industry’s top ceremonies, and gave a mind-blowing 18-minute performance.So, the 33-year-old superstar has shown no signs of slowing down, and it seems that her next big move is only a matter of time. But so far this year, how Beyonce handles the gossip and negativity is even more impressive.After video footage of Solange Knowles, Beyonce’s younger sister, punching and kicking Jay Z in an elevator went viral in May, many realized that things may not be as perfect as they seemed in the music industry’s royal family. Soon, rumors surrounding the couple’s divorce and custody of their 2-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter, got out of hand.Beyonce, who as usual didn’t respond directly to the rumors, has handled the bad press like a superstar. First, in the remix of Flawless, released earlier this month, she addresses the elevator incident with self-awareness, saying “of course, sometimes things go down when there’s a billion dollars on an elevator.” And in the awarding ceremony on Aug 24, she invited Jay Z and Blue Ivy on stage for an emotional moment that stole everyone’s hearts.So, despite of all her success in her music career, the trendsetting superstar uses her recent experiences to show us that it’s OK to be imperfect. All you need to do is to embrace your imperfections. And Beyonce’s already outdone herself in that department.
