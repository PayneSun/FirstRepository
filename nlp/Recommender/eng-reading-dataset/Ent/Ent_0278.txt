Mars sees stars
For this year’s annual White House Easter celebration, US first lady Michelle Obama danced to the song Uptown Funk with cast members from US TV show “So You Think You Can Dance”.Uptown Funk, recorded by American pop singer-songwriter Bruno Mars and English producer Mark Ronson, has ruled the US Billboard Hot 100 Chart for 14 consecutive weeks, tying it for the second-longest run on the chart in history.The Billboard chart measures songs’ sales, radio airplay and streaming data. Members of its “10 or more weeks at No 1” club include Happy by Pharrell Williams (10 weeks), We Belong Together by Mariah Carey (14 weeks), and I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston (14 weeks), all of which enjoyed international popularity.The top honor belongs to Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s One Sweet Day, which reigned for 16 weeks about 20 years ago.MTV music journalist Brenna Ehrlich wrote Uptown Funk had made such a big splash due to its structural simplicity and unique dynamism. You can hardly just sit listening to it and resist the urge to rock your body to it, she said.With only two studio albums under his belt, 29-year-old Mars has already scored five No 1 songs on the Billboard charts, including the soulful ballad When I Was Your Man and the reggae-rock-style Locked Out of Heaven.People tend to pin labels on singers – Taylor Swift is country and pop, Pharrell Williams is hip-hop. But for Mars, it seems hard to place him under just one category.Jon Caramanica of The New York Times believes that Mars’ fame comes particularly from his genius in displaying a wide variety of musical styles.“Mars is one of the most versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that’s an easy fit in a range of styles. There’s nowhere he doesn’t belong,” wrote the music critic.“I don’t really know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing as no one knows what to categorize my voice or my music,” Mars told Vibe.com.“I just know that I’m a fan of all different kinds of genres. You’re supposed to be free doing music and that’s how I feel. So when we get in the studio – whether it’s a hip-hop song, or a big ballad – I want to do it all,” he said.
