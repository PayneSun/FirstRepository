Unborn hero celebrated
It might still be a long time off, but for a character as adorable as Doraemon, it’s never too early to celebrate.If you are a fan of the iconic Japanese anime character, you will know that he was born on September 3, 2112, meaning next month it will be the start of the centennial countdown to his birth.Hong Kong has jumped early on the bandwagon of celebration. Harbor City, a shopping mall in Hong Kong, is hosting the “100 Years Before the Birth of Doraemon” exhibition.Outside Harbor City, 100 different Doraemon figures are lined up in neat rows. Inspired by Doraemon’s magical gadgets, a group of designers around the world have created and designed 30 original gadgets.“Each design has been influenced by Doraemon’s own futuristic world,” Du Lishi, 22, a student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said. “And it feels like Doraemon’s magic comes to life.”The robotic cat from the future, created by Japanese manga artist Fujiko F. Fujio, needs no introduction. The series has been widely popular since its debut in the late 1960s and its popularity has expanded worldwide over the past two decades.For most of us, whether born in the 1980s or 90s, Doraemon is a sweet childhood memory.Wu Hao, 21, a junior at Ocean University of China, is a Doraemon fan. He has decided to watch all the cartoon episodes once again to celebrate the occasion.“When I was a boy, every time I saw Doraemon reaching into his pocket, I knew something exciting will happen,” Wu said.Now, Wu is still in love with the robotic cat, but not only because it was part of his childhood.“I may have outgrown the fairytale-like stories of Doraemon,” he said. “But I believe every Doraemon fan will have a place for the cat in their hearts, because it gives us the courage to dream big.”Du added another reason why Doraemon has been loved by so many fans – his owner Nobita Nobi.“I think many of us can relate to Nobi, who is an underdog and often bullied by others,” Du said.“So, we all wish to have a loyal (and magical) friend like Doraemon, who is always there for you and help you solve all kinds of problems.”
