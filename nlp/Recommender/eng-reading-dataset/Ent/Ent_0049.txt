Influential Wang’s message of positivity
Wang Yuan, 17, a member of Chinese boy band TFBoys, was selected by Time magazine to be part of its 30 Most Influential Teens of 2017 list, which came out on Nov 2.“With lyrics like ‘polish your leather shoes, put on a suit … arrive at every place with head held high’, Wang is not exactly the tattooed bad boy of Chinese pop. But that hasn’t stopped his singing trio, TFBoys, from ruling the charts. Since its founding four years ago, TFBoys has amassed more than 20 million fans on Sina weibo and reportedly sells some $17 million (113 million yuan) worth of branded merchandise every month,” Time wrote. The magazine further pointed out that Wang is ready for greater success － he has appeared in a bunch of movies and TV dramas. But most importantly, he was appointed UNICEF Special Advocate for Education in June.“Education is a right. We should never allow it to be a privilege. Let’s work hard to make education even better in the future,” Wang said at UNICEF’s Beijing office.Earlier this year, Wang took part in the Sixth United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Youth Forum. He made a speech in English on the topic of quality education. “My passion for 2030 is that every young person can access good quality education. Girls have the same potential to achieve amazing things as boys,” he said.There may be little he can do personally, but the message he sent to his fans did a lot more - his post on Sina Weibo about the speech was shared more than 10 million times.
