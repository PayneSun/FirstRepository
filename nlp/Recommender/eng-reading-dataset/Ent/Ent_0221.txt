Sultry siren
It’s probably safe to say that the entertainment industry has rarely seen a figure more polarizing than Lana Del Rey.On the one hand, the 28-year-old American singer and songwriter managed to capture fans with her breathy and delicate vocals, which bring out a sense of nostalgia for the 1960s. On the other hand, she is also – as The Fader magazine put it – “one of the era’s most controversial stars”.With the release of her fourth album, Honeymoon, on Sept 18, she will doubtlessly become the object of debate again.The criticism of Del Rey mainly surrounds her “true identity”. People are suspicious of the fact that she abandoned her birth name, Elizabeth Grant, for a more exotic pseudonym. The way she portrays herself as a small-town girl trying to achieve the American dream was also found to be dubious, especially when people learned that she had a rich father.But show business is not exactly the best place to talk about authenticity. In fact, adopting stage personas is an old trick among pop stars, including American singer and songwriter Bob Dylan, who was born Robert Zimmerman.Del Rey’s authenticity aside, one thing is certain – her music is one-of-a-kind, setting her apart from the current pop mainstream.“While radio playlists are full of futuristic electronic dance beats ... [Lana Del Rey] has taken a contrary path, melodic and melancholy,” commented The New York Times. “Her voice sounds human and unguarded, offering sweetness and ache.”This is why The Telegraph praised Del Rey as “the most authentic kind of fake”.When talking to The New York Times in an interview last year, Del Rey admitted that she sometimes felt close to being crushed by all the controversies, but she managed to stand strong amid the rumors.“Yes, I’m in a different place today than I was four years ago,” she said. “But in some ways I’m still in the exact same place. I’m still on the periphery.”
