Liu wins role of a lifetime
Hua Mulan is the legendary female warrior character depicted in the catchy Ballad of Mulan, written in the Northern Dynasty (386-581). But Mulan isn’t typical of most young women of her time. In fact, she’s so athletic and courageous that she disguises herself as a man to take her sick father’s place in the army.Her story has been brought to the big screen numerous times. And on Nov 30, Disney announced that Chinese actress Liu Yifei would play the lead role in its live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated movie Mulan, which is set to be released in 2019.Many people took to social media to celebrate Liu’s successful casting as a win for diversity in Disney films, given that several Hollywood movies have faced criticism in recent months for featuring white actors and actresses in Asian roles.Chinese-American actress Ming-Na Wen, who voiced Mulan in the 1998 animation, wrote on social media: “Congratulations to Liu Yifei. Great choice for live action Mulan!”“I love Mulan’s bravery and fearlessness,” Liu told NetEase Entertainment. “I am very grateful for Disney’s decision and I will do my best.”According to AP, Liu, 30, was picked out of nearly 1,000 candidates for the role. The filmmakers weren’t only looking for a Chinese actress, but also one with “credible martial arts skills” and the ability to speak English.Nicknamed “Fairy Sister”, Liu is best known for her delicate looks and previous roles in fantasy martial arts dramas. Having lived in New York for part of her childhood, Liu is said to be fluent in English. She has already acted in three English-language movies, including 2008’s The Forbidden Kingdom and this year’s The Chinese Widow.
