Struggling geisha swap tea and poetry for a glass of beer
Say the word geisha and images of beautiful kimono-clad women serving green tea, reciting poetry and playing classical instruments may spring to mind.In Japan, outsiders typically pay hundreds of pounds to spend several hours with geisha in tea-houses, with activities including artful conversation, and dancing.But a downturn in the global economy appears to be forcing the world of geisha to seek more enterprising - and cheaper - ways of earning a living by setting up geisha beer gardens.At the traditional inn Gion Shinmonso, in the ancient capital of Japan, for the 530 yen cost of a beer, visitors can raise toasts and make conversation with trainee geisha, called maiko, before they perform nightly traditional Kyotan dances known as "kyomai" on a special beer garden stage.Meanwhile, the beer garden at Kamischichiken enables visitors to buy a "geisha starter pack" for $21 Cdn, including a mug of beer, two snacks and the company of kimono-clad geisha. "We introduced the service because fewer guests were visiting the inn," said a spokesman for Gion Shinmonso. "We also wanted people to learn more about maiko and geisha. Many more people are able to see them now. They have attracted a lot more customers."The world of geisha blossomed in Kyoto in the 18th century, with young girls trained rigorously in geisha houses an array of traditional arts, from tea ceremony and kimono dressing to playing classical instruments.The number of geisha - who are trained to provide entertainment and no sexual services - peaked at 80,000 in Japan in 1928 but since then has declined to an estimated 1,000 across the country.
