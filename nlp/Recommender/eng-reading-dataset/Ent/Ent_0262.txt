Quiet storm
US actress Rooney Mara, 30, is more than she lets on. In her breakout role as hacker Lisbeth Sander in “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” (2011), she played a character not unlike how she describes herself in interviews – quiet, *inscrutable and remote. This personality has brought her acting high praise from critics, and also invoked *disdain in others.Like Lisbeth, behind Mara’s mystery hides the whisper of talent, and at this year’s Cannes Film Festival that talent spoke to be heard. For her subtle, sensitive acting in period drama “Carol”, Mara took home the festival’s Best Actress award.“There’s something alien and blank about her, like a photo sheet she hasn’t yet put through developing *fluid,” wrote The Telegraph’s Todd Haynes of her performance in “Carol”.Mara plays the love interest of 46-year-old Australian actress Cate Blanchett. Critics predicted industry veteran Blanchett to take the prize, and yet it was Mara who tiptoed her way to the top spot. Her response since the win is befitting of her personality: silence.Colleagues, journalists and even classmates have described Mara in terms less gentle than those she herself might use. In an interview with T magazine, she said she earned her reputation for being distant years before she began to act.“In high school, people thought I was stuck-up because I didn’t talk to anyone,” she said, adding that she is simply shy. “But now people can think whatever they want.”Her plain expression and *subdued confidence, however, are strengths she’s *wielded to master the complex roles she’s taken on during her rise to fame. She powders her skin with the affectations of her chosen role, and when the work is done she rinses it all away.Or, maybe that’s just what she’d like you to think.“Isn’t *mystique and the unknown,” she told T, “part of what keeps you drawn to someone?”
