Hail Queen Nicki
Four years ago, Nicki Minaj rose to the forefront of the rap mainstream by spitting fire over Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy track Monster, leaving her legendary collaborators a pile of smoldering ash and gold chains. Two number one albums later, it’s clear sitting at the grown ups’ table has had an effect on Minaj’s mindset — she’s thinking big and reaching as far as she can with her talents.Young Money’s queen bee has never been shy about her desire to bend hip-hop to her will, and her experimentation hasn’t always gone over well with critics. The release of her last album, the pop-heavy Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, drew ire from some rap enthusiasts. Minaj, they claimed, had sold out. With lead single Starships, critics said Minaj had veered too far into pop territory.“Starships is a blatant pop song,” hip-hop critic Peter Rosenberg told NPR’s Radiolab. “When core hip-hop artists make pop songs it upsets me because it can be a moment that blurs and messes up hip-hop.”Minaj was unfazed by the criticism ahead of the release of The Pink Print, her third LP.“I’m just going to do what my heart tells me to do,” she told MTV.Still, Minaj said that after taking her music so far to the left, she realized in order to move forward, she’d need to return to the style that brought her the attention of so many early on in her career.“The tracks on my next album are back to my hip-hop roots,” she told MTV.Thus far, it seems this isn’t just pre-album puffery.On The Pink Print single Anaconda, which heavily samples Sir Mix-a-Lot’s infamous and infectious Baby Got Back, Minaj effortlessly steps back into the explicit, brag-filled lyricism that’s proven the most potent ingredient in her formula.While it’s too soon to say whether The Pink Print will find Minaj fully back in her preferred scorched earth mode, I remain hopeful. If hip-hop needs anything right now, it’s a female artist who can offer a more legitimate claim to the genre’s crown than Iggy Azalea.
