A faint heart will never win a fair lady
Boy meets girl at high school. They grow up and drift apart. Such are the elementary and timeless ingredients with which Taiwan novelist-turned-director Giddens Ko whips up the playful retro coming-of-age film You Are the Apple of My Eye.Based on Ko’s real-life romance novel The Girl We Chased Together in Those Years (same as the film’s Chinese title), the film is guaranteed to be loved by those who have an appetite for a bit of juvenile fun.Newbie actor Ko Cheng-tung plays Ko Ching-teng, a teenage boy whose life revolves around hanging out with school buddies Boner, Cock, Groin and A-Ho–the bad boys of Ching-Cheng High in Changhua, central-west Taiwan.They all have a crush on Shen Chia-yi (Michelle Chen), an honor student in their class, who falls for Ko only.Yet Ko, afraid of being rejected, cannot bring himself to ask Shen to be his girlfriend.Their love continues after the two go to different colleges until one night, a big fight puts an end to their youthful romance. Several years later, Ko, now a writer, and his high school mates watch Shen walking down the aisle with another man, appearing as beautiful as they remember.With a well-selected cast and a brisk pace, Giddens Ko’s effort manages to keep up a high level of energy throughout the film and he captures adolescent urges with a fun, manga-esque punch.Also, the puppy love story would be less convincing if not for the two leading actors, who convey youthful innocence with effortlessness.The film is at its best when it reminds viewers of their adolescent years. The 33-year-old director has repeatedly said the film isn’t only about his own youth, but everyone’s.It might remind us of something silly or reckless we did at a young age. It might remind us that our youth isn’t all perfect – like Ko and Chen’s.But to the core, it reminds us that our youth, as imperfect as it can be, has made us the people we are today. And for that, we should smile a smile of understanding.
