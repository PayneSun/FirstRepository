TV actors end off-screen relationship
When actors and actresses fall in love on screen, it’s usually just acting. But sometimes, the on-screen chemistry carries across to real life.Yang Zi, 26, met Qin Junjie, 27, while shooting the TV series Noble Aspirations (《诛仙青云志》) in 2015. To better play his role, Qin always stared at Yang to create the feeling of love. The next year, they cooperated again in the TV series The Legend of Dragon Pearl (《龙珠传奇》). And on Valentine’s Day last year, they went public with their relationship.However, after being together for more than a year, Yang Zi posted on Sina Weibo this month: “Nothing is the same as before.” She deleted the post very soon and many people started to believe that their relationship may be in trouble.Indeed, the next day, the two announced on Sina Weibo that after a serious discussion, they’d decided to part ways and return to being friends.
