Why women feel sexiest when they are 28
Most women will have the occasional moan about the length of their legs, the size of their waist or the shape of their bottom.But it seems Pippa Middleton and her peers might find less to grumble about than most – this year, at least.Women feel their sexiest at the age of 28, according to a survey.Miss Middleton, millionairess Tamara Ecclestone and actress Mila Kunis are all at the magic age for embracing their sex appeal, according to the research.Although they may feel most sexy at 28, a woman’s confidence doesn’t peak until she is 32 - with supportive friends and family acting as the biggest boost to their self-belief.The findings come from a new study by Lil-Lets which focused on British women’s attitudes towards being female.Researchers found that most women are happy with the shape of their bum and boobs and the size of their hips and waist.In fact, three quarters of British women said they would not change their body shape if they were given the opportunity.The body part women are most proud of is their eyes, with 23 percent feeling that they are their best physical attribute. Twenty percent opted for their breast, with brains coming in third (13 percent).When asked which part of themselves they would change if they had to, 41 percent of women said they’d like to have longer, slimmer legs.And the aspects of womanhood which they enjoyed the most were getting dressed up, wearing heels and doing their hair and make-up.Although they may feel most sexy at 28, women’s confidence peaks at 32 - with supportive friends and family the biggest boost to their ego.A fifth of those surveyed wished they could be more confident around men while the biggest reason for broken confidence was being dumped by a partner.
