Yoshito Usui may not be a household name to you. But for thousands of Crayon Shin-chan fans, the Japanese manga and anime creator was just as essential to pop culture as Matt Groening, the South Park creators or Seth MacFarlane is to many Americans.Yoshito Usui  born in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, was a manga artist known for the popular manga Crayon Shin-chan.On September 12, 2009, Usui’s family reported him missing from his hometown of Kasukabe when Usui did not return from hiking in nearby Gunma Prefecture. On September 19, 2009, a body with clothes matching those described in the report filed by Usui’s family was found at the bottom of a cliff at Mount Arafune in Gunma. The body was identified by dental records and family members the next day as being that of Usui.Usui launched the manga in Futabasha’s Weekly Manga Action magazine in August 1990, and he has continued to work on the series after moving it to Manga Town and other Futabasha magazines. Shin’ei Doga has been adapting it into a top-5-rated television anime series since 1992, and the television series has itself inspired 17 anime films. CMX Manga has been releasing Yoshito Usui’s original Crayon Shin-chan manga in English in North America. Crayon Shin-chan is a rude young boy who liked girls, trouble and shaking his bare bottom. The funny books were oddly structured, sexually suggestive and often referenced popular culture.According to Futabasha in a news conference, the last photograph in Usui’s digital camera was of the bottom of the cliff from the vantage point of the top. Futabasha’s staffers believe that Usui accidentally fell while taking photographs of the cliff. Fans across the world are mourning Usui’s untimely death. No plans have been announced for the future of the Shin-chan manga.
