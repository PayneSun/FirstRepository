Make Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson gay lovers, fans urge BBC
The creator of BBC TV series Sherlock has been inundated with fan mail urging him to make the detective and Dr Watson gay lovers.Mark Gatiss admitted he had been overwhelmed with explicit drawings and plotline ideas ahead of the new series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, due late next year.It follows a running joke in the show which hints the pair might be closer than friends, especially by landlady Mrs Hudson, played by Una Stubbs, 77, who often makes references to their sexuality.Mr Gatiss, 47, told Australian gay magazine DNA: “Oh my God. I get sent things that would make your hair turn white. It’s not just Sherlock and Watson holding hands on a park bench, I can tell you that.”But the co-creator and actor revealed that along with Steven Moffat, 52, they took inspiration from the 1970 Billy Wilder film and created the joke about Sherlock and Watson’s relationship.The duo first revived Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories for the BBC in 2010, bringing out three series.Earlier this month the BBC announced that a full-length special episode of Sherlock will begin filming in January 2015.The fourth series has already been commissioned and the three episodes are expected to be aired later in the year.The show won the BAFTA for the Best Drama Series in 2011 with Martin Freeman walking away with the award for Best Supporting Actor.Since the show’s popularity, fans have flocked to catch a glimpse of 221B Baker Street – which is actually about half a mile away at 185 North Gower Street, above Speedy’s café.Producers realised the book’s iconic address was too noisy for filming as it is now a major traffic artery.
