Art becomes life
Sometimes it is hard to say whether life copies drama or drama copies life.Chinese actor Luo Jin and actress Tang Yan have worked together in five TV series. Yet their on-screen romance mirrors a real life one.On Oct 28, the couple announced their marriage. They posted wedding photos at the same time on Sina Weibo, writing “I’m the bride” and “I’m the groom”.“Taking into consideration their years together, this looks like romance at its best,” ifeng.com commented.Rumor has it that the pair began to date while they filmed Agent X in 2013 but Luo and Tang only confirmed their relationship in 2016 when they starred in the hit historical period drama The Princess Weiyoung.On Dec 6, 2016, on Tang’s 33rd birthday, Luo posted on Sina Weibo, “You can always have my shoulder to lean on. My dear, happy birthday.” Tang responded, “You are the one that I have been waiting for.”There’s little doubt that Tang means it. “Luo Jin is very sweet. He always takes care of me,” she told Tencent Entertainment. “He’s unselfish. He often puts the people he cares about first. He gives me a sense of security. That’s one of the reasons why I like him so much.”
