Time travel wins fans
Stephen Hawking, one of the world’s smartest physicists, once said: “I’m obsessed by time.Many of us are, and the popularity of time travel TV series has just proved that.After Palace and Startling by Each Step achieved startling ratings last year, Palace 2 aired on January 20, attracting time travel fans back to TV.“It’s fun to watch characters travel back in time and deal with the conflicts between modernity and ancient times,” Xia Xiaoyan, who works for a foreign-owned enterprise in Shanghai, told China Daily.Time travel series connect both today and the past, thus offering room for imagination, said Cai Yinong, the producer of Startling by Each Step.Dream of heroismImagination creates a chance for the young to fulfill a dream that’s hard to achieve in reality.Taiwan writer Xi Juan is a pioneer of time-travel stories in China. In 1993 she published a love story about a young woman time traveling to ancient times.The protagonist’s modern personality and perception of love helps her win the heart of a cool, handsome martial art master. Such a plot satisfies female fans’ love fantasy.Starting from late 1990s, novels about men traveling back to the past prevailed, with A Step Into the Past as the most popular example.In these stories, the male protagonists accomplish great things with their modern skills and wisdom.It’s usually a “dream of heroism come true”, along with enviable romances.The big success of the TV series adapted from A Step Into the Past in 2001 has inspired TV production companies to buy up similar time travel tales. Last year saw their popularity peak.Eye candy“I’m hooked by the shows because they are characterized by dramatic and poetic love and have eye-pleasing actors,” Xia explained her love for time travel TV series.Her comment echoes a 2011 survey by Great Marketing Research Co Ltd in China. When asked about what’s so appealing about time travel TV series, 21 percent of respondents answered: “Those attractive characters.”A bigger reason behind the popularity of time travel stories, however, is the relaxation they offer, according to the survey.Cai Yinong agrees. “Many people are facing tremendous pressures in their fast-paced lives, so this genre is more relaxing than other shows as it provides people with a terrific outlet to escape reality,” Cai told China Daily.Cultural nostalgia“Which dynasty would you like to live in if you could travel to the past?” asked a survey jointly launched by Shanghai University and Shanghai Social Sciences Association last December.About 60 percent of the 2,543 respondents chose Tang Dynasty, while Qing Dynasty, and the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods were the other top two destinations.Ouyang Guangming, professor at Shanghai University, said at the press release: “The survey result reflects people’s definition of the good days: prosperous economy and culture, steady society, fair and uncorrupted politics, and opening up to the outside world.”The love for time traveling is universal.Woody Allen’s latest movie Midnight in Paris, which has been nominated for Best Picture, Directing, Original Screenplay and Art Direction for the 2012 Academy Awards, features modernity versus cultural nostalgia.“The past seems so much more vivid, more substantial, than the present... The good old days are so alluring because we were not around, however much we wish we were,” The New York Times commented.
