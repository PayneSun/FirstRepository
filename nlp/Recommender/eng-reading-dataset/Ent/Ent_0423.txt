Worst holiday gifts ever
Great gifts are awesome. Terrible gifts are not. Want to avoid the drama this year? Here are ten most hated gifts you should avoid.1. Ugly SweatersSome sweaters are so ugly they are incredible, like when your aunt thinks she knows what is really "trendy" these days and the department store was having a sale.2. Surprise PetsUnwanted responsibility? Check. Destroyed furniture? Check. Emotionally scarring pet funeral after finally coming around to loving the little furball? CHECK CHECK CHECK.3. Anything ’Made With Love’... But UnwearableI mean, thanks for the effort?4. A Heartfelt BalladYou are not Elton John, and your gift is NOT your song.5. Gifts You’ve Clearly Grown Out OfOr maybe this is THE perfect way to carry books between classes at law school.6. Tech Accessories For A Device You Don’t OwnKnow what would be even cooler than a case for a smartphone? An actual smartphone.7. Tech Accessories That Are Completely Outdated1998 called, they want their CD case back.8. RegiftsBox from a different store? Scotch-taped? WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID THERE.9. Anything Christmas ThemedReally pointless the rest of the year.10.Skip the drama. Just send cash. Happy holidays!
