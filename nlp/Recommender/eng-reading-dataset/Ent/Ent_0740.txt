Bumbling Bean won’t be back
He is Rowan Atkinson’s most commercially successful creation. However, Mr Bean is unlikely to appear on our screens again in any new adventures.Atkinson, 56, says he believes he is too old to play the bumbling character.Atkinson – who describes Mr. Bean as "a child in a grown man’s body" - said:"Never say never, but I just feel I’m getting too old for it. I’ve always liked Mr. Bean as a cartoon-like figure, who doesn’t really age much. I’ve always seen him as an ageless and timeless being and I’m clearly not ageless and timeless. The older I get, I feel I am less qualified to play him."Mr. Bean first blundered on to television in an ITV series.Despite the derision of some critics, the program proved a huge ratings success, with viewing figures of more than 18 million.The two films, Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie in 1997 and Mr. Bean’s Holiday four year ago, earned 305 million worldwide.
