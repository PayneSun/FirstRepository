Mendes means business
Last month, music streaming platform Spotify released a list of the most influential artists under 25. Unsurprisingly, American singer Ariana Grande, 23, and Canadian Justin Bieber, 22, were among the top five. But ahead of them, on top of the list, is fresh-faced Shawn Mendes, who started his career as an internet sensation but is trying to prove he’s a serious musician.The 18-year-old Canadian singer from *suburban Toronto first started to build an audience in 2013 through video-sharing app Vine, where he uploaded a six-second clip of himself covering Bieber’s As Long As You Love Me.His strong social media presence soon brought him to the attention of the record industry and by 2014, Mendes had signed a major-label deal with Island Records. The following year saw the singer release his first studio album Handwritten.The full-length album was well received, with MTV calling it “the first milestone” for Mendes’ success. Stitches, one of the title songs, has over 500 million streams on Spotify this year alone.Given his loyal fan base and the huge popularity of Stitches, it’s easy to imagine the various ways Mendes’ second album might have turned out–as a shiny pop production, for instance, or a *thumping, trendy *foray into electronic dance music.“Big record, lots of fans–the lane was wide open,” Mendes told Los Angeles Times. He briefly entertained those ideas himself, meeting with some of the industry’s most reliable hitmakers.Yet he ended up taking a different path when producing Illuminate, which was released on Sept 23.The teenager turned to respected songwriters and producers, including Tobias Jesso Jr., a fellow Canadian known for co-writing When We Were Young with Adele, and Jake Gosling, Ed Sheeran’s closest collaborator, who oversaw the British artist’s Grammy-winning Thinking Out Loud.Recalling the demos Mendes sent him, Gosling said he could hear “an honesty and a maturity” that made it clear the singer had decided by then what he wanted to do with the record.“The [maturity] was really coming through,” the producer said, “not only in what he was singing about but in the way he was delivering the songs.”Mendes was also satisfied with the new album more than his debut one, which was pieced together in a rush to *capitalize on his exploding internet fame.“I tried my best, and that’s what I came up with,” he told the Los Angeles Times, referring to the earlier record with a note of apology in his voice.“I feel like this [Illuminate] was my first time really writing, my first time really singing and creating,” Mendes said. “I wanted to prove to the outside world there’s a reason I have 13 million followers.”
