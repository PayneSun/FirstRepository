‘Let It Go’ madness
Disney is well-known for injecting its movies with bright, infectious music that bounces round in your mind for months on end, and no song in recent memory exemplifies this as well as Frozen’s Let It Go.Let It Go vocalizes movie protagonist Elsa’s decision to break free from the strictures imposed on her by outsiders. The song comes at a pivotal moment in the film in which Elsa triumphs over her insecurities and passivity.“This song expresses the positive and negative aspects of Elsa’s story, as she finds her freedom in a frozen home,” said Williams College musicologist W. Anthony Sheppard in an analysis of the song.Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who co-wrote the track, told The Toronto Star she believes Let It Go’s global appeal is a result of its universal themes.“There are so many reasons that we all have fear and shame, and this particular, complicated Disney heroine has to kind of overcome that. I think people are responding to that, to this feeling of, like, I’m going to let my own unique power out and not live in fear of whatever it is I’m dealing with, whether it’s pressure to be a good girl and be beautiful and perfect and [get] good grades, or if it’s something deeper,” Anderson-Lopez said.But Frozen’s success wasn’t as immediate as its current popularity might suggest. Prior to releasing the version sung by Idina Menzel (who also plays the voice of Elsa in the movie), Disney hedged their bets by releasing a version of the song sung by pop star Demi Lovato.“Her version flopped, not just because the arrangement and delivery hobbled the song but because fans didn’t want Lovato to sing it: they wanted Elsa,” writes The Guardian’s Dorian Lynskey.And Elsa they got. The version featuring Menzel has been played more than 250 million times on YouTube, has won an Academy Award, and topped the Billboard charts for weeks on end.“Everyone is bringing their own interpretation to this song,” said Anderson-Lopez, “... and I’m glad about that.”
