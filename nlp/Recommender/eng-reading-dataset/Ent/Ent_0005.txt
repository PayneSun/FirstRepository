Baby on the way for UK duchess
Duchess Meghan Markle is ready to cross off one item on her “bucket list”.Two years ago, she told Lifestyle magazine that becoming a mother was one of her dreams. And on Oct 15, during their visit to Australia, the UK’s royal family announced that Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Markle are expecting their first child.The 37-year-old duchess sparked speculation that she was pregnant by wearing an oversize coat to Princess Eugenie’s wedding earlier this month. That speculation was further fueled when she arrived in Sydney last week holding two large folders in front of her stomach.Markle is said to be in “good health”. The baby was conceived in late July – several weeks after they married in May – and is due in spring of next year, according to the Daily Mail.Some Britons have already started to guess what the royal baby’s name might be. Among the favorites are Victoria for a girl’s name and James for a boy.
