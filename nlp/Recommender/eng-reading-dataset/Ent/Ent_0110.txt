Marvel’s magician
Imagine in a Marvel movie, the *protagonist is a rich, *arrogant and selfish genius who suddenly encounters a life-changing accident. As a result, he develops super powers, before realizing the value of helping others and saving Earth. This isn’t Iron Man, however.The titular character of Doctor Strange begins his story as a regular human being, *albeit the world’s most skilled *neurosurgeon, before a car accident leads him on a journey to discovering Earth-saving super powers.Looking for ways to heal himself after his accident puts an end to his *illustrious surgical career, Strange travels to the East. His discoveries unlock powers that transform him into a master of a mystical magic intended to protect Earth from supernatural enemies.But despite being gifted with superpowers, Doctor Strange is different from other comic book heroes.“He doesn’t have super strength. You can still *poke him with a knife or shoot him with a gun,” says US screenwriter Jon Spaihts, who co-wrote the movie’s script. “Despite all his magical gifts, he often plays a desperate game of ‘stay alive’, fighting enemies far bigger than he is.”At a time when Marvel is producing increasingly *psychedelic work, Doctor Strange is probably the studio’s craziest yet.Rather than present generic superhero scenes, the film shows audiences something a bit different, including Strange being forced to run on the sides of buildings and jump between skyscrapers to escape an enemy who has the ability to bend reality.And while Marvel’s other *eccentric superhero Iron Man is very much one who lives in the spotlight–a genius, billionaire playboy who’s involved in cutting-edge technology projects–Doctor Strange is not, choosing rather to live in his bizarre *abode, the Sanctum Sanctorum, while spending his free time fighting mystical enemies in other dimensions.“It’s obvious why they hired a big time star like Cumberbatch, because Doctor Strange is here to guide us through the next decade of Marvel movies, just like Downey did in the last decade,” Uproxx’s Mike Ryan wrote. “Doctor Strange is basically a *reboot of Iron Man, only with a lot more prettier things to look at. It’s a good strategy. And it works.”
