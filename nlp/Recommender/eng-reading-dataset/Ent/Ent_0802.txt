Game birds turn into love birds
What would happen if someone told you that you were the last of your species? Would you feel privileged or anxious? And what if you find out there’s another member of your species?Inspired by the hugely popular phone game Angry Birds, the film Rio opened in theaters all over Asia on April 8.As The New York Times put it, Angry Birds is “perhaps the first game to make the leap from cell phone screens to the mainstream.”However, the film version tells a different story. It joyfully celebrates the magnificent city, Rio de Janeiro, and the glorious feathers of its parrots. It opens in the jungle of Brazil at sunrise, when the birds wake up and * flap their colorful wings to the samba.Blu, an orphan baby macaw, tests his courage with a trial flight. He is just ready to spread his wings!Suddenly smugglers arrive, and take the macaw to a snow-covered town in Minnesota, US.Luckily, Blu finds a lovely owner called Linda. He becomes a nerdy resident at a bookstore, with a love for reading and enjoying chocolate and marshmallows. Soon, he forgets his sunny hometown. But the arrival of a scientist changes his life. He now believes he’s the last rare macaw on earth.Later he discovers there’s another – and that it’s a female. He leaves the comfort of his cage and travels to Rio. But it’s far from love at first sight. Blu is an insecure bird who finds flying challenging. In contrast, Jewel is a fiercely independent and freedom loving female parrot. She desires to go back to the jungle.On their way they nearly fall into the clutches of the smugglers, who want to sell them for a fortune. Also, they have to chase away an evil pet cockatoo called Nigel.With contagious Latin dance beats and breathtaking landscapes, Rio looks and sounds stunning. It’s a film full of affection and humor.
