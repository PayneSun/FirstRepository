'Octopus oracle' predicts World Cup winners
While bookmakers are using a scientific approach to calculate the odds at the World Cup in South Africa, a member of the animal kingdom proved he only needs shellfish for a 100 percent prediction record.Octopus Paul seems to have taken a liking to the German flag after he successfully foretold the team’s four outcomes in this year’s tournament.Two plastic boxes, one with a German flag and one with their opponent’s, are lowered into Paul’s tank at Sea Life, each with a tasty morsel of food inside.The box which Paul opens first is adjudged to be his predicted winner.Now he has picked Germany to win again, this time over Argentina, in their quarter final match on Saturday.Paul has become a star attraction at the Sea Life Aquarium in the German city of Oberhausen, and his predictions are closely monitored by the media.Aquarium spokeswoman said Paul took about an hour before he made his latest choice, which could mean it will be tough for both teams in the quarter final.It looks like a good thing for German football fans.There are plenty people that don’t believe this, but Paul is two for two so far.He foresaw the German trouncing of Australia on June 13. A few days later — bucking the bookies — he called Serbia’s upset over Germany.Let’s not forget about the other football-prognosticating animals, like Petty, a pygmy hippo at the Chemnitz Zoo who picked Germany to beat Serbia, or Leon, a porcupine — also in Chemnitz — who liked Australia. The Chemnitz staff turns to a new animal for each game, and their latest consultant, Anton the tamarin monkey, has chosen a morsel of fruit in favor of Ghana.Given the nature of their prognostications, the animals have trouble calling a tie. But such trifles haven’t slowed down Paul. According to Sea Life staff, the octopus notched an 80 percent record of forecasts during his last assignment — the UEFA European Championship tournament in 2008.
