Even top officials including Liu Zhijun, the dismissed minister of railway visited Wang and former health minister Chen Minzhang was shown receiving treatment by Wang.Wang claimed he has treated more than 50,000 patients. But the health bureau of Luxi county said Wang was not qualified in medicine and has no license.Wang is among the richest people in Luxi county and one of his villas covers more than 6,600 square meters with a man-made lake.Many of Wang’s patients were rich people and he charged extremely high for services. Zou Yong, one of Wang’s former apprentices recalled, once the wife of a real estate company’s boss came to visit Wang over an illness.
