Remarks ruin childhood memories
Everyone has their favorite cartoon characters from childhood.However, if these characters were to be played by real-life actors, would they still be loveable?The recent actors’ version of classic Japanese anime Ikkyu-san raised this question when a two-hour mini series aired on Japanese TV earlier this month.In case you are not familiar with Ikkyu-san, the anime tells the childhood story of Buddhist monk Ikkyu. He relies on his intelligence and wit to solve all types of problems, from distraught farmers to greedy merchants.In the anime, Ikkyu is known not only for his wit, but also his classic image: shaved head, big and bright eyes, and a lovely smile.In the mini series, the boy monk is played by Japan’s popular child star Suzuki Fuku.I admit that the 8-year-old’s acting is quite impressive. However, his squint isn’t. When Fuku shows up in Ikkyu’s costume, my first impression was: “No, Ikkyu should not look like this.”In Japan, there has been a trend to shoot versions of classic animes with actors. In the past year, there were Chibi Maruko-chan and Ranma 1/2. Last November, the Japanese auto giant Toyota made a series of car ads in which a group of actors played the characters in Doraemon. The adorable robotic cat was played by French actor Jean Reno.OK, that’s probably even more annoying than Fuku’s Ikkyu–given that there are millions of Doraemon fans around the world.So, is the craze for remaking animes with real-life actors a revival of these classic images, or is it simply killing them?“I think most anime fans would feel disappointed,” Zhang Qing, 23, a fan of Japanese anime who is now studying in Tokyo, said.“It’s true that today’s kids might not be familiar with old animes like Ikkyu-san, but I’d rather recommend that they watch the original.”Like Zhang, many Internet users lamented the remakes. “I feel that my childhood memories are ruined,” that’s the most common online review you can hear from the Ikkyu fans.That might be exaggerating a little. But after watching the new mini series, a classic quote from the boy monk can precisely describe my feelings–“I need to take a break”.
