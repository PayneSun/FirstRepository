Holmes is back again
It seems fans of the BBC hit series Sherlock aren’t the only ones who find the death of the titular character hard to accept.In a new mini-episode, which leads up to the big season 3 premiere of the drama led by Benedict Cumberbatch, several of the show’s characters are also finding it difficult to live without Sherlock Holmes and his incredible powers of observation. From the looks of it, John Watson (Martin Freeman) would just like to have his friend back.The seven-minute episode named Many Happy Returns provides pivotal hints at the detective’s fate and introduces everything you need for the new season.Two years ago, Holmes (Cumberbatch) threw himself off the roof of St Bart’s Hospital in the season 2’s finale. A cliffhanger in every sense, it sparked heated debate about how he could have survived. Because one thing we knew for certain was that there would be no show without Holmes.“It’s ingenious, it’s witty. It’s everything it should be,” Cumberbatch told the Daily Express about the third season of Sherlock. And just a few days earlier, Cumberbatch said during the new season’s press meeting that this time, “you find out a lot more about why Holmes is the way he is”.Since his first appearance on screen as Holmes in 2010, the 37-year-old actor has become a successful Hollywood star, with parts in blockbusters such as Star Trek Into Darkness, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and War Horse, and a recent starring role as Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, in The Fifth Estate.But among so many roles, Cumberbatch has a special emotion for Holmes — after all, since the first Holmes was committed to film in 1911, more than 50 actors have played the character.“Sherlock’s got an unfathomable depth of ability. It’s not just about seeing things in a situation — the creative team and what we do with it allow him to expand into different arenas,” Cumberbatch said.Indeed, it’s nice to see what Holmes is like and how he behaves in the age of the Internet and social networks — one of the reasons why we love the BBC series.Soon enough we’ll see how this modern Holmes finds his way back to life.
