Awaken class memories
Reuniting with the family, celebrating Spring Festival, catching up on missed TV series... All of these activities may be on your list of things to do in the winter holiday. But don’t forget one important thing: the class reunion. It’s a great time to hang out with old friends, reminisce about the past and have fun.A class reunion event would be incomplete without a few exciting games. They can help break the ice at the beginning and even become highlights of the reunion. Here are some of our top recommendations.Break the icePhoto competitionThis requires everyone to get a childhood photograph of themselves and put them in a bowl. Then, one by one, the audience must guess who the person is on the photo. This is a good way to ease the atmosphere and create a lot of laughter.Fish pondTo play this game you need pens and blank pieces of paper for everyone.

The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell like those found at hotel reception desks.All players take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. The instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you’re correct, you pick up all the played cards; if you’re wrong, you pay the other players’ one card each. When you run out of cards, you’re out. As everyone competes to hit the bell first, there may be some confusion and funny accidents, that’s what makes it fun.Digital gamesWho’s the SpyThis classic game is now available on WeChat.
