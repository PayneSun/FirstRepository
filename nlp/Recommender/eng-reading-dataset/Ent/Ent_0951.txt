Stand up, local hero
If you want to see Zhou Libo’s ongoing stand-up comedy at the Majestic Theater of Shanghai, you’ll have to wait for a long time. All tickets have sold out soon, although the highest price is 380 yuan for his one-man show.At the same time, Zhou has become one of the hottest topics on all kinds of media, just like Xiaoshenyang months ago and Guo Degang two years ago.Talking about urban lives, economic and political issues in a mixture of Shanghai dialect, Putonghua and some English words, Zhou’s performances have been acclaimed by Shanghai citizens, who long for a local star to speak to their culture."Perhaps at this time, this city needs a performer like me, and I’m willing to offer my joy and thinking to this time and city," he says modestly.Although Zhou’s genre, which he terms haipai qingkou or "Shanghai-style stand-up comedy", is different from Guo’s xiangsheng or Xiaoshenyang’s errenzhuan, they are all parts of a flourishing scene of live comic talk shows, a cultural phenomenon that has drawn more and more attention in recent years in China.Guo just had a performance at the Great Hall of the People to open his Xiangsheng Is Coming series that will last eight months and Xiaoshenyang is touring China. Although Zhou sticks to his hometown Shanghai, his schedule of this year is already full with 120 performances.In A Laughable Talk on the Past 30 Years, a show that premiered last year which made Zhou widely known, he talked about the drastic changes in Shanghai since the "reform and opening-up" in a light-hearted and humorous way. The content of this show included the changes of clothing trends, ups and downs in the Chinese stock market, and the shoe-throwing incident during premier Wen Jiabao’s visit to Cambridge University."Comic talk show performers are becoming more and more popular because they meet the aesthetic needs of the masses, who want relaxation to balance their tension-filled lives," says Bao Shengyong, dean of the Department of Sociology, Central University of Finance and Economics. "Though such demand has always existed, it has been made more apparent in our time."Zhou, who is 42, had a plan to stop performing at 50, and spend 10 years to travel around the world before coming back to perform till the end of his life. Now he has changed his mind."Now primary school students all like me. If I leave when I am 50, what shall they do?" he says.
