Master of the art
Taiwanese actor Chen Chang became a hot topic on social media and most-searched lists because of his performance with Martial arts star Wu Jing, in Kung fu show Painterly Landscape at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala.Unlike Wu Jing, who was born into a martial arts family and began practicing the discipline at age 6, Chang has always been viewed as a skillful, sensitive and low-key actor since his debut in A Brighter Summer Day (1991) at age 15.Though his role as Dark Cloud (or Lo Xiaohu) in 2000 action film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon won him national fame, his first encounter with real martial arts didn’t occur until he fought in the Bajiquan (Eight-level Boxing) style in Wong Kar-wai’s 2013 film The Grandmaster.Half a year before shooting the film in 2009, to meet the director’s requirement of “presenting the real essence and core of Bajiquan”, Chang met Wang Shiquan, a renowned Bajiquan master in Beijing. The first question Wang threw at him was, “Do you truly want to learn Bajiquan or just pose for the camera?” Chang chose the former, and thus his journey to becoming a Bajiquan practitioner commenced. Over three years, according to the Oriental Morning Post, Chang followed his master’s tutoring, and he practiced Bajiquan in the woods in east Beijing and trained for three hours, twice a day, relentlessly.Chang was only in the movie for a total of three minutes, but his practice of the traditional martial arts style won him the top prize in the national Baijiquan contest.Rumor has it that Chang is dedicated to becoming an expert in whatever skills required by the roles he plays. To portray Go master Wu Qingyuan in the movie The Go Master (2006), he also tried hard to learn how to play the game, and he turned out to be a good player in real life. To act in another movie, Missing (2008), a deep-sea-related thriller, Chang is said to have earned his diving license.However, Chang rejects the “studious overlord” title that’s been applied to him by the media and fans. He doesn’t consider himself a particularly gifted actor, telling Tencent Entertainment that he spent time practicing on the piano only to later decide he wasn’t cut out for the instrument. But Chang cares more about learning the process than he does the end result.“I’m curious about new things and have a desire to learn. It’s fun to experience the process of developing a skill from zero,” Chang said in an interview with 163 Entertainment.
