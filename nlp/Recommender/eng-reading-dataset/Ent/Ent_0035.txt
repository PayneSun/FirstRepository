Modern fairy tale
Mexican Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro is known for his “creature features”, directing movies with strange and wonderful beasts that go beyond our imagination.But the director often uses these visual wonders simply as ways to advance the story. Rarely has he thoroughly humanized one of his creatures as he does in The Shape of Water, which focuses on the bond between a mute cleaning lady and a sea creature with extraordinary healing powers.The human characters are almost always the focus of Del Toro’s films, with his monsters usually providing something great to look at for the audience. But the sea creature from The Shape of Water is just as well-developed as any of his human characters, and plays a huge part in the movie.The story follows Elisa Esposito – a cleaning lady who isn’t able to speak due to a childhood injury. Elisa works at a research facility in 1960s Baltimore, US, which secretly keeps a sea creature for scientific studies. Elisa is a lonely woman whose only friends are her fellow cleaning lady Zelda and her elderly neighbor Giles. She gradually develops a relationship with the creature and when she finds out that the facility is planning to kill it, Elisa does all she can to help it escape.In a way, Elisa and the creature are both characters who have no voice so are not listened to, but they manage to communicate with each other without saying a single word. In the meantime, they draw the audience into an unusual yet fascinating love story that touches on loneliness, love and natural human prejudice.In the film, the monster represents something beyond a plot point – it carries a lesson for us humans.“The world in movies and commercials kept telling you that you shouldn’t sweat, you should have perfect hair, perfect teeth, and the monsters give you a chance to exist in imperfection,” del Toro said.
