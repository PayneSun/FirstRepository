Train rides to remember
While planes and high-speed trains get us to our destination quicker, as travelers, we also miss some fantastic scenery along the way. A long train ride allows us to slow down and enjoy more leisure time on the road.Here, we recommend some of the most popular railway trips in China and abroad. Just book a ticket, grab your backpack, and set off on a different experience.Road into the cloudsRoute: Xining, Qinghai to Lhasa, TibetTime: 23-24 hoursKnown as the highest railway in the world, the Qinghai-Tibet railway — or “Heavenly Road” — climbs to 5,000 meters above sea level. Since its inauguration in 2006, it has provided easier access to “the Roof of the World”. On the way, you can view different landscapes: the beautiful Qinghai Lake, the grand Kunlun Mountains, the mysterious source of the Yangtze River, the vast Qiangtang grasslands, and the Yangpachen landscape. When the train passes through Hoh Xil National Nature Reserve, you may even see Tibetan antelopes and other wild animals running on the plateau.Voyage through historyRoute: Xi’an, Shaanxi to Dunhuang, GanseTime: 22-23 hoursFrom Xi’an, the beginning of the ancient Silk Road to Dunhuang, famous for the Mogao Grottoes, this is a trip through China’s history. The relics of the Great Wall in the Ming Dynasty, the Jiayuguan Pass, and the snow-capped Qilian Mountains are worth seeing. In Lanzhou, you can see the Yellow River flowing through the city. As the train passes through the long Hexi Corridor, endless views of the Gobi Desert await.Top choice for nature loversRoute: Guangzhou, Guangdong to Anshun, YunanTime: 22-24 hoursThis is a journey to embrace China’s picturesque nature. You can see dense forests and red soil in the western part of Guangdong Province. As the train climbs to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the gnarled rocky hills, karst landforms and layered terraces will amaze you. With blue skies, verdant mountains and fresh air along the whole way, it’s a good chance to relax and refresh yourself.Trip for all seasonsRoute: Shenyang, Liaoning to Manzhouli, Inner MongoliaTime: 22 hoursThis route stretches into the cold northeast regions of China. In winter, the endless forests covered with snow in the Greater and Lesser Hinggan Mountains are very attractive. In summer, it’s a good choice to escape the heat. There are extensive areas of grassland in Inner Mongolia. At every stop, tourists can experience the thigh-deep snow before returning to the cozy warmth of their compartment.
