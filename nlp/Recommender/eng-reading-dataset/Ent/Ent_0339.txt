Cool weather, cooler records
Bright lyrics and infectious hooks define the summer music season, while music released in the autumn tends to dabble in the season’s nocturnal vibe. There are different sounds for different seasons, and it looks like this fall will breeze along to a promising soundtrack all its own. More than a few big acts are readying new music for release within the next few months.Here, 21st Century’s Darnell Gardner Jr. previews what the change in seasons has in store for music fans this time around.FourArtist: One DirectionRelease date: Nov 17, 2014Label: Columbia RecordsGenre: Pop, pop rockWith three hit albums under their belt, One Direction has displayed a career longevity akin to some of history’s greatest boy bands. On their fourth LP (Long Play), aptly named Four, the group of Brits is poised to continue crooning their way into the hearts of audiences the world over. On Sept 8, when the band announced the album, they also released a free single titled Fireproof. After a whirlwind of touring and recording, it will be interesting to see if One Direction can rally together for a solid fourth effort.The Pink PrintArtist: Nicki MinajRelease date: Nov 24, 2014Label: Young MoneyGenre: Hip-hop, rapAfter weathering scrutiny for her music veering too far into the pop genre, one of hip hop’s hottest MC’s is returning with The Pink Print, an album that promises to satisfy pop fans and rap critics alike. Minaj has compared the album to Jay Z’s legendary The Blueprint, saying her latest will lay the groundwork for the female rappers of the future. Hopefully this album will be Minaj’s return to form, as I’m ready to welcome back her frenetic spin on hip-hop.Art Official Age/PlectrumelectrumArtist: PrinceRelease date: Sept 30, 2014Label: NPG RecordsGenre: Soul, R&BPrince is the undisputed champion of sensual R&B in the US, and he’s held this title for more than three decades. The royally named musician has currently released Art Official Age, his 34th studio album. He has simultaneously released Plectrumelectrum, another LP, with his touring band 3rdEyeGirl. After decades of writing and performing, it’s encouraging to see that Prince still has a clear enough artistic vision to continue producing music this late in his career.Sweet TalkerArtist: Jessie J.Release date: Oct 14, 2014Label: Lava RecordsGenre: Pop, R&B, hip-hopJessie J’s hit song Price Tag, almost four years after its initial release, still regularly gets airplay, proving that the star is here to stay. The pop songstress will follow up on the success of 2013’s Alive with Sweet Talker. In recent years, Jessie’s music has struggled to break into the tough US market. Pop stars are a dime a dozen, and this new album represents an opportunity for Jessie J. to set herself apart from her more popular stateside peers.1989Artist: Taylor SwiftRelease date: Oct 27, 2014Label: Big MachineGenre: PopTaylor Swift has always teetered on the fringes of country music, but this time she’s stepping entirely into the pop limelight. With 1989 (named after her birth year), Swift is hoping to attract a broader fanbase with music that sounds more like the city than the countryside. Lead single Shake it Off debuted at number one on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. Swift has always possessed undeniable talent for catchy writing, and I’m looking forward to getting her lyrics stuck in my head this fall.
