Wonderful woman
Last year, the movie Wonder Woman took the world by storm, and movie fans couldn’t stop talking about its amazing star Gal Gadot. But her attraction didn’t only light up the silver screen, but also the lives of women and girls all over the world.Last month, the 33-year-old Israeli actress was included in Time magazine’s 2018 list of the 100 Most Influential People in the world. “Wonder Woman has helped transform how women and girls see themselves since she emerged on a TV show in 1975. She represents what we know is inside every one of us: fierce strength and a kind heart,” US actress Lynda Carter, who played Wonder Woman in the 1970s TV series, wrote in Time. “Gal understood and captured the spirit of this fully feminine persona.”Gadot believes being a woman takes great strength, because she was raised in a family that taught her that woman are both capable and valuable, she told Rolling Stone.
