Recognition for dark mystery
In my opinion, most award-winning Chinese films at international film events are likely to be indie or artistic ones, instead of genre films. In the case of Black Coal, Thin Ice, the Golden Bear prizewinner at the Berlin International Film Festival in February, my guess was right.Set in the time period from 1999 to 2004, the film tells the story of ex-cop Zhang Zili (Liao Fan), now an alcoholic security guard, and his ex-partner. When a series of familiar-looking murders begins, they decide to follow up on a previous investigation of similar murders that ended their careers and shamed them.The unadorned, unflattering and raw portrait of a mid-size town in winter in North China, all frozen and covered in thick layers of snow, is what I like most about the film. It provides a perfect setting for such a mystery story.Liao, the first Chinese to win the Best Actor award at the Berlin Film Festival for his role in the movie, plays Zhang in the classic mold of the sleep-deprived, unshaven, tough detective. His mellow face may lend itself to comedy, but the film also gives him a chance to show a human side, interpreting big themes like love and betrayal.Another acting highlight falls on Gwei Lun-mei(桂纶镁), who plays a strange, dark lady. She gives the character more depth by blurring the lines between good and evil.As a salute to the classic Hollywood film noir, Black Coal, Thin Ice combines bleakness and pessimism with just the right amount of wry humor. And throughout, director-writer Diao Yinan maintains an impressive mood of unease and approaching danger, which carries the film forward.Although it is a less overtly political film than Jia Zhangke’s recent controversial project A Touch of Sin, Black Coal, Thin Ice does offer a similarly dark and direct portrait of one of the less fashionable corners of China, at a less attractive time of year.While the realistic social commentary implied in the film may be something that appealed to the judges in Berlin, it may also drive away a large number of audiences. Then again, if you’re tired of romantic flicks and no-brainer visual stunts, Black Coal, Thin Ice offers some welcome change.
