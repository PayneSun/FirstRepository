New point of view
Let’s assume you’re not a Marvel fan, or don’t even know what Marvel is. Even so, you must be more than familiar with the superhero characters it creates: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, to name a few.Do those names ring a bell? They all appeared in 2012’s blockbuster, The Avengers, and now Marvel is making a spin-off TV series. That’s why Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is one of the most anticipated new shows of the fall season.If you’re still unsure whether to put it on the to-watch list, read on to find out more about the show.The Marvel logo that opens the show sends a clear message that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a continuation of the film universe.Fans of that universe will find plenty to enjoy, with story elements from The Avengers and Iron Man 3 playing a big role in the plot.But one thing to bear in mind is that the series is not about superheroes. How can a Marvel show not feature any of the main characters showing off their superpowers, you ask?Apparently, Joss Whedon, co-creator of the series who also directed The Avengers and the pilot episode, and his team anticipated this question. So the first episode explains it all with one phrase: “Not all heroes are super.”“In a franchise where we’ve seen average men nearly crushed beneath the boots of gods and monsters like ants, it was surprisingly refreshing to see the world from the ant’s point of view,” Jim Garner wrote in a review for TV Fanatic.Also, by telling a story about the average man in a world of superpowers, the show makes a point of being accessible.“Network television can’t target a niche audience. To be a hit, a show needs broad — as in ‘broadcaster’ — viewership,” a CNN review said.So, it seems that Whedon gives all kinds of viewers, especially those who don’t care about superheroes, a reason to enjoy the show.
