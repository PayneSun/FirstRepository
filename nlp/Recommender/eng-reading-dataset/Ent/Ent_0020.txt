Hard work pays off
Author J.K. Rowling released the first Harry Potter book in 1997, featuring a young wizard who would go on to win the hearts of millions of readers. But although the book series came to an end in 2007, the magical world featured in it still lives on.On May 30, the 52-year-old Briton posted on her official blog that she was working on the screenplay for the movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3, which tells the story of British “magizoologist” Newt Scamander. The film is set to come out in 2020.But what may surprise fans the most is the fact that Rowling has admitted how difficult writing the first two Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movies was for her.“I found screenwriting different from novel writing and very challenging. Basically, I learned how to write a screenplay as I went along,” she wrote on her blog. However, seeing the finished movies left Rowling feeling “in love with the process all over again”, making the hard work completely worth it.
