From love song to rebellion
A music show from Hunan Satellite TV named I’m a Singer has been gaining popularity since the heat from Voice of China gradually cooled. The show invite professional musicians to compete. Rather than using the traditional underdogs-become-famous format, it is up to the 500 audience members to decide the fate of the stars on stage. Let’s check out how the readaptation of a classic love song to rock ’n’ roll introduced us to the emotional world of rock music.In the second week of the Hunan TV music competition show I’m a Singer, Paul Wong surprised his audience members and fellow contestants with a rock adaptation of the famous 1993 hit Goodbye Kiss by Jacky Cheung.Although the lyrics remain unchanged and the original structure is largely maintained, Wong’s rock adaptation of the song turns it into something completely new. No longer is it the sorrowful tale of two lovers parting ways, but an accusation filled with repressed anger.With so much of the original song untouched, what is it that transforms the song to such an extent that the TV show’s host seemed barely to recognize it?A major difference lies in the instrumentation of both songs. Whereas the original relies on a minimal yet elaborate instrumental accompaniment including a backing choir, a harp, and a soloing violin, the adapted version features a classic instrument-heavy rock setup: drums, bass and electric guitars supported by a synthesizer. This makes Wong’s version of the song sound more powerful and direct.But it’s not only the instrumentation and the different sound of the song that makes it a rock version. There is something else, something edgy ― it is the sound of rebellion.Whereas the rebellious character of rock music typically comes from high-volume instruments, a rapid tempo and cutting vocals, the rebellion in Wong’s rock version of this romantic song is far more subtle. It stems from the simplicity in which the melody is played, combined with a slightly dissonant chord progression and a moody guitar solo, letting the emotional expression in the singer’s voice take the foreground and giving the song a darker character.By keeping the original lyrics but transforming their meaning through a reinterpretation of the musical accompaniment, Wong’s adaptation becomes as much a song about rebellion as it is a rebellion against the original version of the song itself.
