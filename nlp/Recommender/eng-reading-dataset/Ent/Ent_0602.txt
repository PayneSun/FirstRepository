A new TV generation
If names like Joe Cheng, Lee Da-hae and Li Yifeng were put together in a series, you would think it was just another romantic TV series with pretty faces.Well, almost right. Love Actually, featuring the above actors, is a new romantic comedy series currently airing on Hunan Satellite Television.What makes the series special is that it is the first romantic-comedy series on the Chinese Mainland with an element of food and cooking.The series centers around Qiao Zhixia (played by Lee Da-hae), a naturally talented chef who works part-time jobs to scrape a living. Her fate changes when she meets real-estate agent Chen Haojie, whose family owns a prominent restaurant chain.From there the series follows Qiao as she works her way up to become a successful chef, and, eventually, how she meets her prince charming.Combining food and romance is not new. There have been several drama series of this kind in the US, Japan and South Korea, and Chinese films in this category include Eat, Drink, Man Woman , God of Cookery and The Chinese Feast.“As a pioneer in this territory on Chinese TV, Love Actually aims to be inspirational, like many other works about cooking,” said Cheng, who plays Chen Haofeng, the “poker faced” manager of his family business, in an interview with Sina.com.“On the other hand, we want it to be refreshingly romantic. I think delicious food and romance are a perfect match.”Food and romance work well together. Both are “sensory experiences that need to be tasted in order to understand how lovely and beautiful they are”, according to the series’ director Lin He-long, who is known for making romantic dramas in Taiwan.“The story is about love, after all,” Lin explains. “A good chef cooks with love and therefore the food is delicious.”“The same applies to people. If you believe in love, you’ll find true love – that is the recipe of love.”
