Woman on the rise
It’s hard to keep up with Ariana Grande.With one of the fastest-rising careers in the entertainment industry, the 24-year-old US singer and actress is the current talk of the town.As the summer break came to an end, Grande held her first concerts on the Chinese mainland. She took to the stage in Beijing on August 26 and went to Guangzhou on August 30 as part of her worldwide Dangerous Woman tour, named after her 2016 album.Grande released her first album, 2013’s Yours Truly, at the age of just 20. The former children’s TV star has since changed from an everyday pop artist to a global superstar. After releasing her second album My Everything in 2014, she continuously had a single in the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 for 34 weeks, and had the most top 10 singles of any artist that year.What sets Grande apart from stars of similar backgrounds is her powerful voice and wide vocal range. Unlike peers Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato, Grande’s star power is rooted in the fact that she can really sing. More importantly, she knows how to control her voice – which is both strong and sensitive at the same time – and isn’t afraid to try new things.The young star has always known what she’s wanted. At the age of 13, she became serious about pursuing a music career. “I remember when I first came to Los Angeles to meet with my managers, and I said, ‘I want to make an R&B album’,” Grande told Billboard magazine.Her albums are big hits all over the world, and her tour dates have been selling out all over the place. But to Grande, the best part of her career is that she’s getting to do what she loves most. “Music has always been first and foremost with me,” she told Rolling Stone magazine.
