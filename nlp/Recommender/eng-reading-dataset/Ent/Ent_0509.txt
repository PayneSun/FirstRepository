Accessorize your look
Sometimes, more than the skirt or the blazer, it’s the accessories that make dressing up so much fun. They are like the sprinkles on the ice-cream scoop of your outfit, the little touches of joy that you can dabble with to spice up an old favorite or that boring but useful blouse.But before you invest any money in interesting pieces, meet the accessories that are defining this season.Luxe cuffNothing injects a more opulent vibe into your look than a bold piece of luxe cuff. Strong and sophisticated, the arm candy is heavily inspired by the fashion statements of Egypt’s last pharaoh Cleopatra, also known as “Queen of the Nile”.This season’s luxe cuffs ― featured on the runways of designer brands like Lanvin, Hermes, Chloe and Celine ― range from sleek, oversized bangles in bronze, silver and gold, to leather pieces that blend studs, rivets and rhinestones.But if it’s the luxe cuff that you wish to sport, make sure you keep the rest of your getup down.Bib necklaceJust when you thought your bib-wearing days were over, one of the hottest trends in accessories comes in the form of bib necklaces.The origin of this big, dramatic necklace ― generally made of multiple layers of stepped pearls, stones or metals ― is believed to date back to the days of ancient Egypt. Elizabeth Taylor, who played the famous Egyptian queen in Cleopatra, sports such a necklace in the 1963 movie.The trend has been growing over the last few years, but it quickly gained popularity after Dior and Lanvin used these bold, statement-making pieces in their 2013 spring/summer collections.Dudette capIt looks like we’re driving our boyfriends crazy ―after stealing their jeans and blazers, we’re now taking their caps, too.Some people call it the baseball cap, while the punk crowd call it the dudette cap. Regardless of its name, the cap is leaving a mark on this season’s accessory trends with its effortless sense of cool. The spring runways made use of caps to style everything from leather ensembles to flirty dresses.For lazy days, the dudette cap is a nifty way to up the style factor of even the plainest white tee and denim shorts combo.Oversized earringsOne of the biggest accessory trends of this season is oversized earrings. Supersized gold and silver hoops reminiscent of the 1980s, feathered and fringed earrings with old Hollywood glamour, and vibrant ones crafted with multicolored beads ― these are among the best choices for this season.So don’t be afraid to go big and bold with your earrings. But do remember to choose lighter ones that don’t stretch your earlobes to avoid harming your ears.
