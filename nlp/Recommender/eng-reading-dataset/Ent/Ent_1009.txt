‘Wheat' opens Shanghai Festival
A STIRRING historical war movie opened the 12th Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF), an event that is growing in international profile as the Chinese film biz continues to thrive.The fest, which runs from June 13 to 21, opened with He Ping’s historical action drama "Wheat," He’s first film since "Warriors of Heaven and Earth" in 2003.Shanghai’s fest has long been seen as a provincial affair, but the growing muscle of the Chinese film biz means this year’s event is much more closely watched than ever.The jury is headed by "Slumdog Millionaire" director Danny Boyle.Most of the market section of the fest is taking place in the Shanghai Exhibition Center, a much larger venue than in previous years, a reflection of how the booming Chinese film business is bucking the global slowdown.The festival presents several themes this year. Ten movies by master director Alfred Hitchcock will make their China bows, as well as six films by France’s Isabelle Huppert.SIFF will also feature the work of Korean director Im Kwon-taek, and there is a real arthouse element with pictures by French New Wave auteurs Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard to mark the 50-year anniversary of the movement.At the heart of the festival is the Jin Jue (Golden Goblet) Award, which attracts 16 films to compete, including Yao Shuhua’s production "Empire of Silver" and Tibetan filmmaker Wanma Caidan’s "Soul Searching."
