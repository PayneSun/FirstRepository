Actors who step into famous people’s shoes
To play a famous political leader or war hero is a daunting task for any actor. British actress Helen Mirren played the lead role in The Queen, a movie about the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death.Mirren said she felt comfortable in the role as soon as a gray wig was put on her head. It so altered her appearance that she felt as if she was Queen Elizabeth II.It’s difficult for an actor to play a famous historic figure without slipping into caricature. In other words, exaggerating the way the character speaks or moves to the point where it becomes comical.British actor Timothy Spall played Winston Churchill in the Oscar-winning film, The King’s Speech.Spall admitted: “I’m very nervous about playing an icon. This is a part where you can’t hide behind a bad impersonation.”Some critics complained about Spall’s performance as Churchill. One critic described him as “pouting, scowling and waddling around like The Penguin” (in the Batman movies).In other words, Spall was accused of delivering a caricature of Churchill.I watched the movie and I thought Spall’s performance was spot on. He didn’t look like the great man, but he’d captured Churchill’s essence.Celebrity look-alikes in the West generally are not considered actors. They are ordinary folk who, by an accident of birth, resemble someone famous.Personally, I wonder what’s the point? Marilyn Monroe was justifiably famous for her beauty and acting. David Beckham is renowned for his soccer skills. Elvis Presley had a wonderful voice.Celebrity look-alikes may appear to be the double of someone famous, but they don’t have the talent.Yet there are lots of agencies with lists of look-alikes. For a fee, they will appear in your TV commercial, at your corporate entertainment event, marketing promotion, wedding or private party.It strikes me as kind of spooky, but then I’m not starstruck.
