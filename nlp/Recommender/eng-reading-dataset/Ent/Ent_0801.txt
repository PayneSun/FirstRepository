Fanning the flames of true love
Ten years can wear down a romantic relationship, or it can let love blossom.For Taiwan singer Christine Fan , it’s the latter. Her 10-year love affair is about to culminate in a wedding.As for the ceremony, the star has the simplest taste. She wants to wear flat shoes, have some snacks and chat with close friends.  “I’ ll let my boyfriend Blackie take care of every thing,” said Fan with typical humor. “I only have to make sure I show up on time.”Like her burgeoning romance, this superstar’s singing career is also on the rise. Her new best-selling album Love & Fanfan is both a witness to their 10-year love affair and her own philosophy. The lyrics of the album’s title song The Most Important Decision speaks her mind.“You have a bunch of shortcomings. You become so *stubborn that even the fairy  *stomps her feet in anger. “But life is far from being perfect, and you are my most important decision in life,” Fan sings.Instead of seeking perfection and glory, the singer seems to always enjoy a peaceful way of life. Her music reflects her simple style of dressing. And she has one simple reason for selecting her Mr Right. Fan admitted: “He’s just a *quick-witted and smart-talking guy who never bores me.”Their relationship went official when Chen carried Fan on his back out of her home during a flood. They had a seven years’ *itch, but survived it when Chen proposed to Fan during an NBA game last year.As Chen said: “Regardless of ups and downs, we are still together. We’re just like a *compass and she is the center point. My life has no direction without her.”
