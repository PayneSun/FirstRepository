Patriotic stars sing for world
“We love the country we the Chi-phenomena,” raps CD REV, a music group founded last year by four post-1990s Chinese youth. “The red dragon ain’t no evil but a peaceful place.” These are lyrics from the group’s English-language music video This Is China (《听好了，这才是中国！》), which has received widespread attention both at home and abroad.“There are many misunderstandings about China in the Western world. We want to offer people an objective image of China through our music,” says Wang Zixin, 22, one of the group’s rappers, who graduated from Sichuan University of Media and Communications last year.In the song, Wang and his group mates not only acknowledge China’s accomplishments like advanced mobile payment technology and cutting-edge space programs, but also noted serious problems brought about by the country’s rapid development such as air pollution, food safety and political corruption.“Both the good and bad sides we mentioned are all Chi-phenomena,” he explains.Rational peopleThe group first released the song’s music video on weibo in June, with fans then going on to share it on foreign websites across the globe. This led to many Western news outlets, including the BBC and Time, running stories claiming the song to be nothing more than “*propaganda”.“Facts are facts and I believe those rational people overseas will make the right judgment,” said Li Yijie, another member of the group who is now a senior at Sichuan Normal University.Some have also referred to the group members as “little pinks”, a term used to describe young people using the internet to attack those who are thought to have *belittled China.“We always ignore these words because we believe the meaning of *patriotism for today’s post-90s is quite different from past generations,” says Wang.He holds that *abiding by the law, cherishing everyday life and maintaining a positive attitude are all the true meanings of patriotism for today’s youth, saying that any negativity aimed toward others under the *banner of patriotism is *misguided, such as the case of Hou Jüsen last year. The teen from Shandong province picked an online quarrel with someone who *assaulted patriotism but was later taken into police *custody after the internet argument turned into a real-life fighting.However, the group doesn’t reject criticisms about its musical competency. “The views are reasonable and we will continue working hard to improve our music recording capability,” they said.“Using music to express our love of life and country and providing positive energy to the post-90s will be the constant theme for us in the future,” added Wang.
