Newest celeb couple?
It’s been a beautiful year for Timothee Chalamet.At 22, he became the youngest actor in 80 years to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Later, videos of him dancing and rapping went viral, making him one of the most popular men in Hollywood. And earlier this month, the US actor was spotted hanging out with Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of famous US actor Johnny Depp, in New York City.The two met each other while co-starring in the movie The King, which just finished shooting and is set to come out next year in the United States. In the film, Chalamet plays King Henry V, while Depp acts as his wife Catherine of Valois.Although Chalamet and Depp haven’t publicly announced their relationship status yet, a Chalamet fan account posted pictures of the pair together eating at a cafe, then taking a walk. An eyewitness told Us Weekly magazine that they looked like “a new young couple in love” during their romantic walk together. “They were walking down the street and he stopped her and pulled her close,” the eyewitness said.Whatever the nature of their relationship is, it should be noted that Chalamet is not a big fan of the word “date”. “Date is very much a scary word, because then that context has been established. You can always see people on early date behavior,” he once told W magazine.
