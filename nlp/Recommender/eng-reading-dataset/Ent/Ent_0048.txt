Don’t forget family
A lot of films have tried to describe the afterlife and our memories of family members who have passed away. But few have done as well as Coco, Disney-Pixar’s latest masterpiece animation, which hit the big screen on Nov 24.“One thing’s for certain – you’re going to want to call your grandparents after seeing Coco,” wrote film critic Katie Walsh on The Record.Inspired by the Mexican holiday of Dia de los Muertos – Day of the Dead – the film’s production team created a young boy, Miguel, who wants his family to understand his love of music. On that year’s Dia de los Muertos, an accident takes him to the Land of the Dead. While there, Miguel has an unforgettable and adventurous night.According to the Guardian, the Land of the Dead is one of Disney-Pixar’s “most visually ambitious worlds yet”. In this land, there are friendly skeletons who can cross a bridge made of flower petals on Dia de los Muertos to “visit” their living family in the world of the living – that is, as long as their family still puts their photos on the family shrine. Those spirits who are forgotten by their family will perish and disappear completely.It’s in this magical world that Miguel gets to meet and discover the truth about his great-great-grandpa. To save him from perishing, Miguel has to bring his photo back to the living world as soon as possible.While told with a wild imagination, the story sends out a clear and warm message about family – “whimsical and bone-deep, all at once”, as Vanity Fair put it.Family is a concept at the center of Mexican culture. On Dia de los Muertos every year, people in Mexico honor their ancestors by putting their photos up on the family shrine, as shown in the film, and share food and drinks to keep the spirits of their family members alive.“In an era when young people are so easily attracted by celebrities, Coco reveals the emptiness of such adulation, teaching kids to preserve and respect the memory of their elders while reminding them that the source of true creativity is so often personal,” wrote reporter Peter Debruge on Variety.
