Celebrity love is hot gossip
So, Barbie Hsu did it again. No, we’re not talking about this 34-year-old actress’ romance with a younger man. We’re talking about the fact that her love life is constantly lived in the public gaze. In this latest case, it’s her sudden engagement to Wang Xiaofei, 29, heir to catering tycoon South Beauty Group that’s set media tongues wagging. Public figures have different ways of dealing with rumors regarding their so-called private lives – whether they are in a committed relationship or have split with a partner. Some are candid, like Hsu, while others remain tight-lipped. Let’s take a look at how different rumor-afflicted stars react and respond under the public gaze.Wang and Hsu both responded to the widespread rumor about their engagement through their mini-blogs. Hsu said: “I knew he’s the one when I first met him. I met him three times before we got engaged. I have to say, we’re made for each other.”US actress Kristen Stewart was rumored to be in a relationship with fellow actor Robert Pattinson (both above sight). Stewart was quoted as saying that she intends to always keep her romantic life private: “Cock-and-bull stories. They’re absolutely not true and come from out of nowhere. I would never cheapen my relationships by talking about them. People say, ‘Just say who you’re dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it’. It’s like, ‘No they won’t! They’ll ask for specifics’.”Gossip Girl co-stars Blake Lively and Penn Badgley split recently after three years together. Badgley told the Us Weekly that both parties handled the breakup “professionally”: “Some would say it’s a double-edged sword (to still work together after splitting). But in our case, we’re professionals and we manage to balance it well. We’re separated for good. But we’re still friends and hang out on the set.”
