Britain's youngest beauty queen
A nine-week-old baby has become Britain’s youngest ever beauty queen.Ella Oliver’s mother Jenny, 27, entered her into the Miss Natural Sparkle UK contest before she was even born.Mother-of-three Jenny, from Blackpool, was seven months pregnant - and knew she was carrying a girl - when she sat down to register her unborn baby into the competition.Ella was born by caesarean on July 23 and just 68 days later her doting mother dressed her up and carried her down the catwalk to be judged.Jenny wanted Ella to follow in the footsteps of sister Jess, seven, who takes to the stage kitted out with make-up.Former child minder Jenny, who paid £10 to enter Ella, said: ’I didn’t put any make-up on Ella because she is too young for that, so she was natural. She wore a really pretty pink dress and head band, she even smiled for the judges. She didn’t have to do a talent or show confidence because she can’t walk or talk so I think it was judged on cuteness. I don’t know if Ella wants to do pageants but I don’t think it will damage her.’Pint-sized Ella was crowned with her first sash and tiara.Despite coming under fire from fellow parents, Jenny and mechanic husband Steve, 29, will continue to chaperone their daughters to pageants across the country.They have already been to 10 different contests and spent more than £2,000 pounds on dresses, shoes, travel, hotels and accessories in the past three years on Jess.Leanne Woodall, Miss Natural Sparkle organiser, said: ’Because beauty pageants are a family event and the whole family like to be involved we decided to introduce just one round for newborns this year. Parents dressed their babies up in little dresses or suits. It was judged on cute factor and Ella won. We thought she looked adorable in a little pink dress and head band. She was presented with a sash and crown. It’s something nice for her family to keep and show her when she is older.’
