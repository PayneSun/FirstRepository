Captivating love story
When a film is made in three languages, it usually takes courage and patience to watch.South Korean director Kim Tae-yong’s remake of Late Autumn, a 1966 South Korean film, is in English, Chinese and Korean. And it doesn’t disappoint.Starring Chinese actress Tang Wei and South Korean actor Hyun Bin, Late Autumn is an enchanting tale of two unlikely misfits who fall in love, against all odds.Director Kim’s subtle, nuanced direction elicits wonderful performances from his lead actors, crafting a lyrical and captivating love story.The screenplay follows the original: Chinese-American Anna (Tang) is in prison for killing her husband. She is allowed parole for 72 hours to attend her mother’s funeral in Seattle. On the bus, she lends the bus fare to a South Korean escort named Hoon (Hyun). The story between two strangers begins.The plot is similar to that of Before Sunrise (1995) as the couple spends a day and a half exploring the city.At the major turning points of their relationship, they engage in a child-like play-acting. In one scene Hoon pretends to be Anna’s fiance at the funeral and provokes a punch-up with her jealous ex-lover.Apart from the light-hearted scenes, dialogue is limited. Under Kim’s direction, the film is surprisingly peaceful and chaste.However, it is during the narrative’s silences and pauses that deeper feelings have a chance to emerge. For example there is a scene at a bus stop, in which the camera circles Anna as she mills about in the mist looking for Hoon. Her distress and sense of loss echoes the opening shot of her staggering down the road the day she killed her husband.In Late Autumn, Tang replays her sullen, repressed character in Crossing Hennessy, and Hyun’s performance is impressive–for not underplaying the dandy, narcissistic side of his personality.Last but not least, there is the third main role in the film–the city of Seattle, which appears beautiful and romantic, yet foggy and drab, with hardly any color or smell of autumn.
