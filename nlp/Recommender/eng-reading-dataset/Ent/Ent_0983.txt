Harvard freshmen say 'look at me'
Harvard’s online Freeze College magazine holds a beauty pageant for newly enrolled male students every year.Being Mr. Harvard Freshman is really a tough job: in addition to looks, the winner needs to have a sense of humor and an outgoing, charismatic personality. But before all that, he has to undergo a rather grueling competition to win the title.Out of over 700 freshmen from all over the world, 80 are chosen to take part in the contest. A second vote by students picks 30 to go on to the next round. Only 13 can make it to the final, in which they undergo a strict exam. After that, online voters select their favorite man, and a Mr Harvard Freshman emerges.This genuinely fair procedure means that Mr. Harvard Freshman deserves his legend, "the star of Harvard".This year the 13 contestants are from America, Singapore, France and Finland, among other countries. Their different cultural backgrounds make for different personalities. Some are athletes, some are refined; others are nervous, obviously scared by the occasion.In order that students can get a better insight into the young men, Freeze College makes available detailed online profiles to Harvard’s voting public.On the topic webpage, there are questions for the guys to answer; for example "Why do you think Harvard are the best?"But flattering the female voters doesn’t necessarily make a candidate a winner. Last year’s Mr Harvard Freshman, Siddhant Singh Dormi, from Mumbai, India said that a relationship should develop naturally; showering a girl with complements wasn’t the way to her heat. The simplicity and honesty of his answer must have gone a long way to winning him that year’s Mr Harvard Freshman title.
