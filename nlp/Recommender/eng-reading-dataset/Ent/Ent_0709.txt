You don't want to make the cat angry
If you’re a fan of the Shrek series, you must remember the lovable cat in it–with his hat, boots and sword. He’s even got a lovable Spanish accent courtesy of Antonio Banderas.His name is Puss in Boots and he’s back–with a film of his own.Playing a feline version of Zorro, Puss is considered an outlaw when we first meet up with him. In the film Puss in Boots, the events take place before he meets Shrek and Donkey. The Puss here is a swashbuckler, a world-renowned adventurer.Puss learns about some people who have come into possession of magic beans. To help him snatch these beans, there are Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), the female equivalent to Puss, and Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a mastermind of sorts.In the film, the adventure and invention never flag and the tongue-in-cheek humor doesn’t linger far behind. It has the same level of wit and originality we got with the first Shrek movie, and none of the hackneyed or blasé baggage we got from any of the sequels.The jokes in the film are balanced between what works for children and what works for adults. There are jokes we see coming, but that doesn’t make them less comical.Much of that is attributed to director Chris Miller’s great sense of timing–the way he reveals things at the right time and how the characters react. He delivers with enough flashy imagery, bright colors, and attractive characters to hold everyone’s attention.Banderas deserves much of the credit as well. With his distinct voice, he gives the Puss enough energy to bleed into the animated character’s face.The combo of Puss as a physical character and Banderas’ charismatic and spicy voice creates this long-remembered icon of animated film, one who truly deserves his own movie.If DreamWorks Animation continues to follow the Puss in Boots route, if the Shrek days are behind us and the days of the feline adventurer are ahead, there might be many adventures for this character to get into.If told with the same panache and gusto given to Puss in Boots, they are sure to be stories worth enjoying.
