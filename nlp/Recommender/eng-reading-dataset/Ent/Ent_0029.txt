DJ’s sad end
He was one of the biggest international pop stars, blowing thousands of fans’ minds with his electronic dance music.But despite his fame and fortune, Swedish DJ and producer Avicii passed away on April 20 aged just 28 years old in an apparent suicide, according to Newsweek.“Our beloved Tim … was an over-achieving perfectionist  who traveled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress,” his family wrote in a statement. “He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace.”Avicii was open about his mental health problems and decided to quit showbiz in 2016. “This was obviously the hardest decision of my life so far. But so far it has paid off tremendously in terms of well-being for me,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “I’m more stress-free than I have been in a very long time.”
