Movie debut for Styles
As someone whose career in music started off with an audition on UK talent show The X Factor, Harry Styles’star continues to rise. He first found fame in boy band One Direction aged 16, before going soloin 2016. His self-titled debut album stormed the charts in several countries, including the UK, the US and Australia, and the 23-year-old will kick off his first world tour on Sept 19. The Harry Styles Live on Tour shows will start in the US before ending in Japan in early December.But it seems all this wasn’t enough for the young star. Styles made his movie acting debut in Dunkirk, which came out in China on September 1.Dunkirk is the latest movie by Christopher Nolan and depicts the famous British troop evacuationacross the English Channel during World War II. The film features stars like Tom Hardy and Oscar-winner Mark Rylance, but as Business Insider put it, “When you leave the theater after watching Dunkirk, one of the performances you’ll likely remember most will be the acting debut of Harry Styles.”Styles plays Alex, one of the soldiers trying to get off the beach. His journey proves to be extremely hard after he has to escape a sinking destroyer while avoiding being shot at by Germans soldiers. But according to the new actor, that wasn’t the most difficult part.“It’s so different to try and completely remove yourself from a situation and be someone else. It was something new for me,” he told USA Today.And while Styles chose the dark and scary setting of a World War II battle for his first film, that isn’t stopping fans appreciating his acting debut. His character spends much of his screen time dripping wet, and sporting a 1940s British haircut makes him “almost impossibly attractive”, as The Daily Beast wrote. “It’s only a matter of seconds before it’s no longer important that you’re watching Harry Styles on screen. All that matters is whether he survives,” it continued.
