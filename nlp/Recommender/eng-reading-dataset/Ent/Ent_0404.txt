Century-old selfies
Selfies have become ubiquitous over the past few years, with everyone from pop stars to the president of the United States jumping on the bandwagon - but turns out the photo craze is at least a century old.Writer and photographer Tom Byron has shared with the Internet community a handful of ’selfies’ taken by his great-grandfather dating back to 1909.Unlike today’s compact smartphones and slender tablets, taking a selfie a hundred years ago was a complicated task that required the photographer to hold a large, boxy apparatus in front of him.The resulting images appeared disordered and out of proportion, similar to a reflection in a fun-house mirror.In the prints aged by time, Mr Byron Clayton, a bespectacled, moustached gentleman, is depicted smiling for the camera in his hand alongside his friends all dressed in impeccable suits and bowler hats.Joseph Byron Clayton died in 1923, after which his son took over the Byron Company and continued to run it successfully until the middle of World War II, when business experienced a downturn and the company closed for good in October 1942.Tom Byron, a married father of three, who earned several college degrees in economics, followed in his ancestors’ footsteps, working as a photographer until 2010, when he retired.
