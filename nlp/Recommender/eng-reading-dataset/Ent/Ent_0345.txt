Ariana rising
So far, this year’s global music market has definitely been dominated by women: Beyonce Knowles, Taylor Swift, and Iggy Azalea are all making waves. And one hot name that adds more conviction to the list is US singer Ariana Grande.Almost exactly a year ago, Grande released her debut album, Yours Truly. And over the past 12 months, the 21-year-old former Nickelodeon (an American TV channel for kids and adolescents) star has transformed from a pop artist you might recognize to an unapologetic superstar. She now boasts three top 10 singles in the current Billboard Hot 100 chart, an impressive opening performance at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards, and millions of followers on social networking sites.Her sophomore album, My Everything, which was released on Aug 25, is the latest sign of her coming dominance. It debuted at No 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart this week, making her the only other female singer after Scotland’s Susan Boyle to have two consecutive No 1 albums in a single year.OK, with all the glitter and glamour aside, let’s talk about Grande’s trump card — her powerful voice and wide vocal range. Unlike her peers Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato, Grande’s star power is rooted in the fact that she can really sing. More importantly, Grande knows how to control her voice, which is at once strong and sensitive, and use it to expand her musical territory.My Everything is the best example. In this album, Grande literally tries her hand at everything: dance music (Break Free), R&B jams (Be My Baby), hip-hop tunes (Problem), power ballads (Why Try) and even ’60s-inflected pop (Bang Bang).While you can clearly sense her ambition as a singer, you will be impressed by how effortlessly she handles these different styles of music, especially if you have listened to Yours Truly, a more cohesive, ’90s R&B-influenced project.Of course, one suggestion for Grande’s future music would be for her to display more personality instead of simply parading around her vocal talent. But not to worry; based on what we’ve heard thus far, it’s safe to say Grande is well on her way to growing into her own.
