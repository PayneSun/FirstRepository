A footloose and fancy-free summer
For many women, shoes are their guilty pleasure. They dream about shoes, save up for them and when they finally get the pair they’ve wanted so badly, they feel like the happiest people in the world.Now, summer is here and shorts and miniskirts mean that your shoes are no longer overshadowed by long pants and coats.So, pack away your Uggs and take advantage of some of the sandal-based trends and styles for summer.Heeled wedges and espadrillesThe wedged-heel shoe is still on trend for this summer. Whether a small 5cm heel or a sky-high 15cm platform, the rope-lined heel of an espadrille provides a chic, but still casual look that makes this shoe the perfect complement to any summer outfit. And heeled espadrilles even look great with shorts.Structured sandalsGladiator sandals have been in style for a couple of seasons now, but there was always one big problem with them: not enough support. Strappy sandals can often leave you in a lurch when the delicate strap pops off.But this season, we’re seeing a little more structure in the heels of the summer sandals.Braided sandals, or sandals with buckles have appeared in several top designer collections. Bright colors and unusual ways of braiding make these incredibly hot for the season.Super mega platformsGenerally speaking, such platforms aren’t exactly in Lady Gaga’s style but they do look weird. However, they are comfortable to wear despite their appearance. So, the platforms can be worn as day-to-night sandals.When you’re on the go during the summer, you may not have time to slip home or to your dormitory between a day at the mall and a night at a club.But with a great multipurpose sandal like this, your shoes will be ready for anything.Pointed toes, bright colorsThose who like to wear high heels, take rounded toes off the list for this season. This summer, we see the change towards pointed toes that are much sexier and more feminine.And, just like this season’s trend for clothes with bright and bold colors, colorful sandals are also in style.Even if you wear simple and light outfits, a pair of sandals with bright colors can make you stand out and demonstrate an attitude.
