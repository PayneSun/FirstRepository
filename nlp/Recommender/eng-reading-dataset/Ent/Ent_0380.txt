Prince George is new fashion icon
Prince George of Cambridge’s cuddly kangaroo backpack has sold-out just hours after his father Prince William debuted the item on his arrival in Sydney on Monday.The eight-month-old bag features the Australian animal carrying a joey and now parents have gone out of their way to order the item online.Vendors have been forced to display a ’This product is out of stock or unavailable’ message to those hoping their tot will be as fashionable as Kate Middleton’s little boy.Customers flocked to purchase the carrier when images emerged of the Duke and Duchess taking the tiny royal onto Wellington, New Zealand.The frenzy to emulate George’s style comes after he starred in a new royal family picture with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, plus their dog Lupo last Sunday.Personalised baby retailer My1stYears.com say they sold out of pale blue jumpers this week, which retail at £25 each.The site shifted more than 1200 in the four days following the publication of the photo and bosses said there were a higher number of orders for ’George’ than they would usually expect from customers."Personalised baby gifts have grown tremendously in popularity over the last five years and this photo certainly gives it the Royal seal of approval," Director Daniel Price said."The demand took us by surprise. We weren’t expecting to see a shot with Prince George wearing a jumper with his name and our similar jumper sold out quickly. Luckily we were able to restock to fulfill orders, but it’s since sold out again."
