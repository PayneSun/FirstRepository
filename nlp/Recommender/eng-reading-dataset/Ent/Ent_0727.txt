Fall back on our guide to autumn
Cooler temperatures, striking colors, smaller crowds–autumn is the perfect time for travel and tourism.Here, 21st Century picks five places that are listed by National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best fall trip destinations. Don’t worry if you can’t go to these places. By reading this page, we hope to take you on a grand tour and let you experience fun and culture around the world.Cannstatter VolkfestStuttgart, GermanyStuttgart’s Cannstatter Volkfest is billed as the world’s second largest beer-drinking event–following Munich’s Oktoberfest. But it is considered Germany’s more authentic celebration of local heritage and, of course, beer.Launched as an agricultural fair in 1818–a symbolic 24-meter-high “fruit column” pays homage to the past–the three-week festival (from September 23 to October 9 this year) features live music, a re-created Alpine village, and carnival rides.The action centers on massive festival tents each accommodating up to 5,000 revelers.In addition, Stuttgart is recognized as a global car capital. Both the Mercedes-Benz and Porsche museums are worth a visit.Zanzibar,TanzaniaThis mystical archipelago on East Africa’s Swahili Coast has witnessed human history: sultans, sailors, slaves, and spice traders have all passed through here once.Located about 35 kilometers from mainland Tanzania, Zanzibar consists of two main islands–Unguja and Pemba–plus numerous smaller islands.The diverse history (dating back at least 20,000 years to the Paleolithic Age) and natural beauty, including turquoise water, coral reefs, and white sands, create an exotic backdrop for a fall beach or diving vacation.Top stops include the slave memorial erected on a former auction block, and Beit al-Ajaib, a 19th-century sultan’s palace that’s now the House of Wonders Museum of History and Culture of Zanzibar and the Swahili Coast.Churchill,Manitoba,CanadaHere in the northern Canadian town at Hudson Bay, visitors can see the area’s most famous fall residents–polar bears.More than a thousand of the world’s largest land carnivores migrate through the “polar bear capital of the world” during October and November, when the first ice forms on the edge of Hudson Bay.The frozen conditions make it easier for hungry bears to hunt for seals (by walking instead of swimming).Under the snowy, winter weather, visitors can hardly have too many clothes to put on. Insulated boots, jackets, and gloves; layered clothing; thermal underwear; and woolen socks and hats are required.Dublin,IrelandThe Ireland’s capital and largest city is a center for arts, entertainment, culture and commerce.With few tourists and lower temperatures, fall is the ideal season for walking the historic Georgian streets and cruising the River Liffey.Visitors can explore the city’s 20 square kilometers of public gardens, nature reserves, and parks, including St. Stephen’s Green, which borders Grafton Street, one of the world’s most expensive retail locations.Along the way, enjoy traditional, paper-wrapped fish and chips at Leo Burdock.Healthier eats will be on the menu on October 31, when more than 10,000 runners are expected for the National Lottery Dublin Marathon, dubbed “the Friendly Marathon” for the affable crowds cheering on the pack.White Mountains,New Hampshire ,USWhile peak fall foliage varies annually, the 160-kilometer White Mountain Trail typically delivers brilliant fall colors from the end of September through the second week of October.The iconic New Hampshire tourist attraction celebrates its 150th anniversary in 2011.Even after the leaves have fallen, meandering this National Scenic Byway reveals classic fall scenes–historic covered bridges, granite mountain peaks, dramatic gorges, rushing waterfalls, and bucolic farmhouses and barns. Each section of the loop displays a unique personality.Driving the Kancamagus Highway, visitors can experience mountain vistas, see moose and bird watch.There are also tax-free tourist shops and plenty of restaurants on the trail.
