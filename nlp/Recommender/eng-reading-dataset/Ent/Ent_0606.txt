Chinese stars don't exploit their fans' nicknames for them
Chinese music fans seem to have got into the nickname game early.I remember watching the early Supergirl singing contest. Fans in the audience held home-made boards with nicknames they made up for their favorite contestants.Like in 2005, when today’s superstars such as Li Yuchun and Zhang Liangying were on the show, fans created nicknames with the theme of food, of course, using homonymic characters in their names.For example, hefan (packed food) for He Jie fans, yumi (corn) for Li Yuchun fans.And from then on, the trend kept going on, mostly in various talent shows.However, the phenomenon doesn’t seem to be the result of the emergence of social networks–fans were spontaneous the whole time: they formed fan bases and apparently needed cute names for them.And singers don’t seem to “take advantage” of this. As Nina Beckhardt mentioned, singers could use this kind of “namescape” and develop a personal brand, or an image, like what Lady Gaga has done with “Little Monsters”.She had an album titled The Fame Monster; teamed up with the headphone company Monster, makers of the now-ubiquitous Beats By Dr Dre; and she recently started a social network site LittleMonsters.com.Also, some monikers are examples of sophisticated branding that evokes a set of meanings about the artists.For example, Katy Perry’s “KatyCats” and rapper Wiz Khalifa’s “Taylors”–Perry loves cats, and Khalifa’s favorite shoes are his Chuck Taylors.So, when Chinese fans say “I’m a …”, it doesn’t mean anything more than “I love his/her music”.The nickname phenomenon can actually go further here. And it doesn’t hurt for Chinese singers and their teams to think about.
