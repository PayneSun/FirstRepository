Song and dance fun
Although it’s acceptable for characters from Disney animations (动画片) to suddenly break into songs and dances in the middle of a conversation, it’d still be weird (怪异的) for “real life” actors to do the same, wouldn’t it?But the impromptu (即兴的) songs and dances are what La La Land － a musical film － is all about. This pattern worked surprisingly well: The film opened last year’s Venice Film Festival, won a record-breaking seven Golden Globes in January, and it already has 14 Oscar nominations (提名), including best picture, best director and best costume design. La La Land was released in China on Feb 14.But why is it that a musical is making history all of a sudden?It’s believed that the current political climate is driving people toward light-hearted entertainment for relief – especially movies like La La Land, which tells a simple boy-meets-girl story. The tale takes place in an ever-sunny Los Angeles, where everything is painted in a positive light, which may be another attraction for those looking to escape the world for a short while.“This was the only time for me since Nov 8 that I was successfully able to shut out all thoughts of Trump World for over two hours,” wrote The Guardian’s editor John Patterson. “La La Land, if only for a while, quite rid me of anger, cynicism (愤世嫉俗) and anxiety.”This is not hard to understand if you think about the last time musical films had their moment of glory. It was more than half a century ago, back in the 1930s through to the 1950s, when the Great Depression (经济大萧条) hit the US.“Politicians often allotted (指派) Hollywood the task of ‘cheering Americans up’ during the Depression, hoping that the entertainment industry could play a key role in distracting (使……转移注意力) Americans from the horrors (恐惧) of the economic downfall,” wrote Sydney Huber on the blog Music During the Great Depression.Despite being a musical filled with a dream-like atmosphere, La La Land has its fair share of realism. The boy-meets-girl story doesn’t end in a happily-ever-after way. Instead, they have to make a choice between their relationship and their careers, like many couples in the real world.“There is a modern energy to it,” Damien Chazelle, the film’s director, told The Independent. “It was fun to take certain [characteristics] from fifties musicals, but put them in a modern city and film them in a modern way, and see what resulted from that.”
