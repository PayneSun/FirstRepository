Some episodes sparked heated debates about the effectiveness of torture, and others touched on issues of press freedom and nuclear arms.During its run, the show garnered numerous Emmy awards, including best drama series in 2006.Another hot TV show "Lost" finale cops an average of 13.5 million viewers in the United States, with fans hardly finding out answers to all of the questions posed by the six-season serials.Though the show’s finale got its biggest audience since February of 2008, many fans were disappointed and concluded that the long-anticipated finale raised more questions than it answered.Some other press reports said that 20.5 million people watched the finale. That was the number of people who watched as little as 6 minutes of the 2.5 hour final."Lost" won the Emmy Awards for best drama series in 2005 for its first season, then went missing for two years.
