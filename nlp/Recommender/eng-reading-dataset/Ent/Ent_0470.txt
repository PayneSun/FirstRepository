Awkward family photos – Chinese style!
We all have the odd photographic skeleton in our closets - those embarrassing childhood pictures that we hope never see the light of day.But it seems that Chinese Weibo users are more than happy to air their most cringeworthy snaps of bygone days.Weibo users have been taking to the website in their droves to post hundreds of hilariously awkward pictures to amuse their friends using a hashtag that translates as ’showing off some embarrassing photos of our childhood’.The photos, many of which appear to date back to the eighties and early nineties, show the youngsters in a range of bizarre outfits and wearing far too much make up.While some parents have gone for the sophisticated look while dressing their little angels, others have just gone for the downright bizarre.Old before their time: These Chinese girls have presumably been raiding their mothers’ wardrobes.Made up: These two young Chinese boys were careful to ensure that their lipstick matched their ties.In the army now: These two girls having taking patriotism to a new level, but it’s not clear why they are kitted out in full military regalia.Bling: These two youngsters are all dressed up to the nines in their furs and finery.Fancy dress: These youngsters probably won’t be using these images on their Weibo profile page any time soon.Fruity: The girl on the left looks less than amused that her outfit has been adorned with fruit and vegetables, while the girl on the right looks slightly happier with her choice of extravagant make up.
