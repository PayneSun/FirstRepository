The new 'sexy'  scene for Harry Potter
The latest Harry Potter film will feature a “very sexy” love scene in which actor Daniel Radcliffe appears nude alongside co-star Emma Watson. Director David Yates revealed that the scene in Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows takes place as Harry and his best friend Ron Weasley, played by Rupert Grint, are battling a monster. The creature uses magic to show the images of Harry with Hermione Granger, played by Watson, to Ron, who is madly in love with her.Mr Yates said: “We’ll create something that feels very sexy and very intriguing to bring about a reaction in Rupert.”“Dan has appeared nude in the past. There are a couple of scenes in the new film in which he will undress, but we’re still thinking about how we present it.”“There is another scene in King’s Cross station, where Harry almost dies and sees Dumbledore. In that scene, he will also be naked.”However Mr Yates picked another scene in the film as his favourite. “It’s where Hermione and Harry dance together and is not in the book. It’s something we create for the film and is actually very tender,” he said. “They also reveal some secrets about each other while dancing.”The first of the two-part final chapter of the Harry Potter films is due out next November.Radcliffe, best known for playing the role of Harry Potter in "Harry Potter" series, appeared totally nude for his role as Alan Strang in the stage play "Equus" last year.Despite widespread criticism, the play itself was a success that he’s been billed to reprise his role on Broadway.As Dan grows up, people pay more and more attentions on his private life. The 20-year-old actor once said that he prefers to court more mature ladies. "I have been out with a couple of women who are slightly older than me and I just think … I just enjoy it," he said. "I think it’s the maturity thing."
