Bravery in a broken heart
Florence Welch just fought a war, and from the sound of it she’s won, but not without casualty.On “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful”, her third album as the face of British indie band Florence and the Machine, Welch, 28, learns to dig her heels into the dirt and spit thunder back at her enemy – heartbreak.The album’s opener has Welch turning inward, questioning if she always knew her relationship would crumble.That contemplative mood lasts approximately four minutes. By the second track, Welch is already puffing out her chest and readying to unleash her voice, a weapon known to knock flat anyone who hears it. Not much later, she’s deep in the trenches.Florence and the Machine probably didn’t set out to prove they could score the next Hollywood blockbuster, but that’s what they’ve done here. This album sounds so big you can practically see Welch charging toward the frontlines. It’s the kind of music that can and eventually will blow the roof off the top of a stadium, and that’s not entirely positive. Horns, drums and guitars advance so powerfully at times that you, the listener, might feel you’re the enemy.All that noise might get Welch’s ferocity across, but her quieter emotions get lost somewhere in the background. It’s the quieter emotions that add human form to a heartbreak album, and it’s disappointing that you’re often left digging through the rubble to find them.Noise complaints aside, however, it feels natural to cheer Welch on as she struggles out of grief.Songwriting on the album is uplifting and encouraging. This is never truer than on “Third Eye”, a track that finds Welch’s conscience boldly demanding she quit brooding, realize her own worth and clad herself in newfound toughness. It’s the album’s high point, and it’s great listening to her shake off defeat.“How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful” shouts that it’s bravery that mends a broken heart, and by the album’s end, it’s clear Florence Welch has bravery deep in her bones.
