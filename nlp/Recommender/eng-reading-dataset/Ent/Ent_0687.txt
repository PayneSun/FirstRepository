When buddies become lovers
Do you believe in pure friendship between a man and woman?Yes, that’s a tacky question. But like “love at first sight”, screenwriters, filmmakers and TV producers still have a lot to say about platonic friendship.The latest work of this type is the Taiwanese romantic drama In Time With You, which tells the story of Cheng Youqing (Ariel Lin) and Li Daren (Bolin Chen), who end up together after being each other’s best friend for 14 years.They have very different personalities and sometimes you just don’t see the attraction. Cheng’s a tough, stubborn young woman; Li is a warm-hearted, soft kind of guy who often gives in to Cheng’s bad temper and takes care of her.All his kindness to her is in terms of friendship of course, because Li has once said that he would never fall in love with a girlfriend like Cheng. The pair also swear that they would never be romantically attracted to each other.During their search for potential lovers, Cheng often says the girlfriends Li finds don’t suit him. Meanwhile, Li is not happy with the guy Cheng is going out with. As time goes by, Li can’t deny his feelings for Cheng. Yet he’s unwilling to accept the truth because he doesn’t want to ruin their friendship.So, as “I would never fall in love with you” becomes “I might not love you”, the series comes back to a simple point: to hide the true feelings in one’s heart, or, to take a risk and tell the truth?It’s a hard decision either way–lying to ourselves is as painful as the risk of losing one of the most important people in our lives. But Li takes the risk anyway–fortunately, Cheng is there for him, like always.The ending might make you believe less in platonic friendship between men and women, but it also seems to deliver a positive message: If you’re lucky enough to have a soul mate like Cheng or Li, never let him or her go, because he or she might be “the one”.
