All the presidents man!
An artistic student from a school near Rochester, New York decided to embark on a photography project of a different kind.Each day, Chaz Rorick from Rush-Henrietta High School decided to upload an Instagram photo of himself impersonating a U.S. president alongside a photo of the actual president.Many would agree the impressions are uncannily familiar.Rorick’s project started when he realized his outfit resembled that of President Harry Truman while watching a documentary. He took a photo of himself, placed it next to one of Truman, and posted it on Instagram.He had an instant fan: his father. ’The next day I did Roosevelt for fun, but by the third picture I did one a day, regardless of my busyness. My friends enthusiastically encouraged the weirdness,’ the high school junior told Mashable.According to RochesterHomepage.net, Rorick said of his project, ’It was not too much work, maybe half an hour a night doing it, except for the ones with wigs and mustaches. I cut out paper for it. I taped cotton to my head.’’It was fun though,’ he added. ’All my friends supported it. My parents supported it. History teachers are crazy about it.’Harry S. Truman: The entire project began with this picture. Chaz’s dad loved it so much, he decided to take photos of them all.Richard Nixon: Something on your mind sir? Or nose, perhaps?George W Bush: Was that a pretzel I just ate?Abraham Lincoln: Capturing the look once again, Chaz sticks on a beard instead of waiting months to grow it.Blues brothers: Bill Clinton should think about dueting with this high schooler...Lyndon Johnson: Is that you Ladybird? No, it’s Chaz - again!John Quincy Adams: Note the clever use of cotton wool and tissues for instant sideburns.
