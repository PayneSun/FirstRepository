Red carpet puts style on trial
Fan Bingbing had no idea that her “red crane gown” signified something different in France when she sported the dress on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival last week. In China the crane is a symbol of good fortune and longevity. But in French culture it symbolizes meanness, war, and evil women. Fan’s faux pas was simply another celebrity wardrobe malfunction. Stars can easily get it wrong at their moment of *glitz and *glamour. Even fearless celebrities get cold feet when they step onto the red carpet. “I always get that panic when I step out of the car that everyone is going to hate it,” Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt said. She told Femalefirst.co.uk she was afraid to make a fashion faux pas. The ultimate blunder for a red carpet attender could be showing up in the same outfit as another star who looks better in it.To avoid such embarrassment, American singer Rihanna often texts her celebrity pals before big events to make sure their outfits don’t clash.“Katy (Perry) and I speak all the time about what we’re going to wear. And (Lady) Gaga,” Rihanna told The Mirror. However, not every star is allowed as many outfit choices as Rihanna and Gaga, who have joined the A List. If a star is on the A List, designers will give their samples as gifts. Sometimes they will even specially design a dress for a big star. But less famous stars more typically get their pieces on loan from designers and jewelers, according to Annabel Tollman, fashion director at Interview Magazine.For stars who borrow dresses, walking the red carpet is even more difficult. As borrowed dresses need to be kept intact, they are often seen in dresses that don’t fit and accidental exposure happens.  And things can get ugly when borrowed dresses are stained or trashed. After a tight Nicola Finetti dress burst on Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) in 2006, the pop singer was said to be blacklisted by some designer stores.
