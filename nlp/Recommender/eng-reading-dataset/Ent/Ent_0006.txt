Anyone can be a winner
The fictional superhero Spider-Man is familiar to us all, with his red and blue webbed costume. And now, it’s time for Venom, a character who first appeared in the 2007 Spider-Man 3 movie, to take the spotlight.UK actor Tom Hardy, 41, who stars as the title character in the movie Venom, plays “a lighter antihero with both good and evil minds, who is supposed to be an alternative to the standard superhero,” reported BBC News.In the film, TV journalist Eddie Brock is a strange man who often breaks things and screams. To some extent, he’s regarded as a loser as his life is full of trouble, including a breakup with his fiancee.Soon in the story, Brock is infected by Venom, a being from outer space. By sharing a body with it, Brock changes into a 3-meter-tall monster.People may think the monster with a snaking tongue and sharpened teeth is powerful, but it turns out that Venom is also “a loser” on its home planet.“Most superheroes or supervillains are individuals; it’s just about one person. And what’s unique and really awesome about Eddie and Venom is that it’s like one plus one equals three,” the movie director Ruben Fleischer told CBR News.The superhero with a scary yet smiling face has uncontrollable superhuman strength, as well as a darkness inside of him. At first, Brock’s alien “visitor” simply begins as a voice in the journalist’s head. But soon, it takes over Brock, attacking those he doesn’t like and causing trouble.In an effort to find a proper way to co-exist, Venom helps Brock in his fight against a super-rich man who is furious over a report Brock writes on an evil scheme the man’s planning. And eventually, Venom and Brock decide to work together to stop evil from taking over Earth.So the message Fleischer wants to send to audiences is that even those with a humble background can develop power. And as a line near the end of the movie proves when Venom tells Brock, “I’m a loser like you”, we can all become heroes if we work together.
