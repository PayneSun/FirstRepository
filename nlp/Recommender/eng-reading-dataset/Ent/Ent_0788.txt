Youths’ wit and wisdom
Li Yuchun, the 27-year-old singer and actress, used to be known as a bit of a tomboy. Recently, though, she has softened her image and become more feminine. She seems to be adopting the style of “China’s literary youth”, which is spearheaded by Taiwan singers Chen Qizhen (also known as Cheer Chen) and Zhang Xuan.The “literary youth” are a group of knowledgeable, young Chinese people who like to embrace an artistic and spiritual way of life.They have some interesting habits, such as wearing long, flowing skirts, walking around either barefooted or in canvas shoes, watching small-budget art-house movies and carrying around small camcorders.“I had intentionally projected a domineering image on stage before, which distanced me from others,” said Li. “But now I’d like to show a different, fresher and more accurate side of myself.”Li’s new album, which came out on April 12, is called The Literary Youth Who Can Dance (《会跳舞的文艺青年》). On the album, she challenges people’s fixed perceptions of China’s “literary youth” and “pop dancers”.She asked: “Who says that the ‘literary youth’ cannot dance, or that pop dancers can’t be artistic and try to play musical instruments?”Li believes that at core the “literary youth” are marked by an unpretentious attitude to life, which is conveyed in her music.Her songs have a laid-back flavor, combining light-hearted dance rhythms with vivid images.For instance, on the album’s title song, she sings, “The sun has fallen in love with rainy days.” In another song, she sings about “riding a bicycle to get close to the moon”.Li’s new album has both confirmed her as a member of China’s “literary youth” and opened her up to a brand new audience.“I’ve only just begun to discover Li from this album,” music critic Ma Xiangxin told the Information Times. “For the first time, I think I can converse with her on a musical level.”
