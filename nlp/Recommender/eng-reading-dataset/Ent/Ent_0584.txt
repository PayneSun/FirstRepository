Epic adaptation, or sex cliché
The highly anticipated movie White Deer Plain, hit Chinese movie theaters on September 15, two days following its original release.Directed by Wang Quan’an, the movie is an adaptation of Chen Zhongshi’s 1993 historical novel by the same title, which is an epic tale of two peasant families in White Deer Plain, a peaceful village in the province of Shaanxi.Tracing the Bai and the Lu families from 1910 to 1938, the movie observes, from a peasant’s point of view, the political changes that took place in the country.If you have seen the movie’s trailer, you will know that explicit sexual scenes play a big role in it–a third of the two minute trailer is dominated by sex scenes involving the character of Tian Xiao’e (played by Zhang Yuqi), a beautiful, bold and capricious young woman.Although there are few sex scenes toward the end of the 150-minute movie, Tian plays a key role in the story’s development, and her sexual attitude is constantly under scrutiny as she gets involved with a series of men.It makes people wonder: what does sex have to do with such an epic piece of work?To a certain extent, it is in accordance with the original novel. When Chen’s novel was first published in 1993, it sparked controversy for its frank sex descriptions.“It’s not an erotic novel, but there is a need for such characters, because marriage, family and sex are indispensable when deconstructing one’s life,” Chen explained during a Q&A session on the 20th anniversary of the book’s publication on September 12.Chen, who called the novel “an artistic experiment”, added that by showing the wildness and human desire of some characters, the sexual content gives more humanity to the historical background–but it is never the main focus.In the novel, which covers a longer time period than the movie (from the 1910s to 1950s), the character of Tian, who appears most in the sex scenes, dies halfway through the story.In the movie, however, director Wang focuses on Tian a little too much. Maybe this is because Zhang is his wife, but Wang unwittingly makes the movie fall into the “sex sells” cliché.“To pull off such a long and complex story is not easy to do,” movie critic Wang Siwei commented on his Sina Weibo. “There are many details, characters and storylines in the novel that Wang had to skip given the limited time of the movie.”“He has made his own version of White Deer Plain, aided by the book’s solid foundation. And he just decided to go with the main character of Tian.”
