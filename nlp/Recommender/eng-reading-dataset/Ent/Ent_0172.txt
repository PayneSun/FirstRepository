Rebel debut
A year ago, British singer Zayn Malik announced on Facebook that he would be leaving the British boy band One Direction.“I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight,” he wrote. But it turns out, h                                                                                                                                                                        e is now more in the spotlight than ever.Newspaper headlines have chronicled his evolution from band member to pop music rebel. First there was the public spat with producer Naughty Boy, then his split with his British pop star fiancé Perrie Edwards. Now, he’s getting attention for his relationship with 20-year-old US model and reality TV star Gigi Hadid.But what’s more impressive is that he was able to sign a solo deal with RCA Records. Compared to his music career as a boy band member, Malik has achieved just as much – if not more– success as a solo singer. He released his debut album, Mind of Mine, on March 25. It sold over 9,000 copies in one day, outselling Adele by almost 3-1, reported Daily Star. Though Malik’s sales are expected to slow as the week goes on, while Adele’s daily numbers are holding steady, that’s still a big deal.The media has been praising his music too. The Atlantic deemed Mind of Mine “the pinnacle of the current sad-dude pop moment”. But for Malik himself, the debut album means more than just continued fame. Having a solo record allowed Malik to explore his interests in R&B music, whereas previously he’d been limited to the pop/rock he performed with One Direction.Even in his earliest days as a musician, Malik loved R&B. Many of his fans still remember when Malik appeared as a contestant on the reality TV show, The X-Factor. He auditioned with the song Let Me Love You, an R&B hit by Mario.In an interview with The Fader magazine last year, he also revealed that he struggled not to do R&B in One Direction. “If I would sing a hook or a verse slightly R&B, or slightly myself, it would always be recorded 50 times until there was a straight version that was pop,” he said.For Malik, successful music is a reflection of the artist’s true spirit. So far, that commitment to authenticity has earned him the respect of some major music critics, including The Guardian’s Michael Cragg.“The lasting impression of Mind of Mine... is of someone finally making the music they’ve wanted to make for a long time. That the sound he’s chosen... is basically 2016 writ large may seem bandwagon-jumping, but there’s more than enough good stuff here to suggest it’s been created with love rather than with an eye on ticking boxes,” said Cragg.
