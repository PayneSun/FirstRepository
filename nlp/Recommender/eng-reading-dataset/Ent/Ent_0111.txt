Celebs stand to attention
Hunan TV has returned to its former glory in the reality show field thanks to the strong comeback of military reality show Takes a Real Man (《真正男子汉》).Since the Oct 21 premiere of the second season, the show has outperformed its debut season in every aspect. Its rating (1.98 percent) almost doubles the average figure of the first season (1.03 percent), not to mention the many topics related to the show that soon became the top search terms on social media.However, as a show featuring celebrities taking on the *rigorous and daunting task of training as military *recruits, the new season actually appears less *solemn and more *irrelevant to its theme.While the participants of the first season were all men who mostly had some connection with the army – Wang Baoqiang, 32, gained overnight fame thanks to the 2006 series Soldiers Sortie (《士兵突击》) and the youngest, Liu Haoran, 19, showed an extraordinary passion for firearms – half of the new recruits of season two consist of four relatively delicate females, even including a lactating mother, Tong Liya.But rather than discuss the show’s military aspects following the season premiere, most internet users were more interested in talking about which women possessed the most natural beauty after removing their makeup.Among the four male soldiers, 25-year-old fitness *fanatic Jiang Jinfu seems the most at home in the *barracks. Owing to his passion for fitness, Jiang is disciplined and came out on top in almost every competition, including by a *startling 45 points in a five-shot shooting race.But it’s Huang Zitao, 23, who acts like a wild horse without reins in the show, who’s winning the viewers’ hearts, as the Baidu Index and comments on the show’s Sina Weibo accounts show.The rebellious actor is not scared to release his unruly, yet *hilarious, true self. Viewers saw as he mocked his 21-year-old *drillmaster, saying he looks 30. He then decided to ask the trainer to wear a helmet after he was commanded to do it himself. Even many haters of Huang say they’re now turning into fans because of his *authenticity. However, it’s perhaps almost predictable that he’s going to be transformed into a “real man” with the help of *perseverance and responsibility in the end, although the show claims to have no scripts.As an entertaining reality show, Takes a Real Man is an *indisputable success. But will it, like its underlying theme encourages, buckle down and become a more serious example of military training? Only the upcoming episodes will tell.
