Here’s what it found.JapanJapan has historically been one of the most expensive destinations for travelers.However, aggressive deals that didn’t exist a year ago are popping up all over the country now – a bid to recover from the *devastating *tsunami of 2011.The Japan Tourism Agency (JTA) reportedly proposed last October to give 10,000 free flights to foreign visitors, starting from April 2012 when cherry blossoms are in full bloom.Deal Experts from Travelzoo’s Tokyo office say top hotels are reducing rates by as much as 50 percent.ThailandLike Japan, Thailand is also in recovery from disaster. The months-long flooding has left the country hungry for tourists. As waters *recede, the government and *hoteliers are quickly sounding the all clear and advertising incredible deals.“We’ve seen hotel occupancy after the floods dropping by 40 percent,” says Gabe Saglie, senior editor for Travelzoo. “2012 will be a good year for Thailand.”The MediterraneanStretching for 46,000 kilometers, this tourist *paradise *lures millions of tourists every year with everything from white sandy beaches and rolling *dunes to superb *redolent cafes.“The region holds a heck of a lot of charm and cultural and historical appeal,” says Saglie. “Mediterranean *cruises provide a budget-friendly option for traveling to and throughout Europe.”The good news is, Saglie adds, that Norwegian, Celebrity and some other cruise lines are putting a record number of ships on the routes. Ports of call include Spain, France, Greece and Italy – with weeklong cruise prices starting at less than $600 (3,804 yuan) per person.Costa RicaThe multicultural country in Central America is the perfect destination to get in touch with nature in an adventurous way.
