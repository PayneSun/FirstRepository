Brighton bus drivers banned from calling female passengers 'babe'
A bus company is warning drivers to not call passengers ’babe’ in a bid to avoid lawsuits from offended women.Brighton & Hove Buses posted warnings to drivers in its head offices after a complaint from a woman who said she felt insulted by being called ’babe’ when she boarded a bus.The company also warned drivers they could face the sack if they call passengers ’love’ or ’darling’.One employee, who did not want to be named, said: ’It’s just the height of political correctness. The drivers know how to best speak to customers.’People don’t want their drivers to be robots. What is the world coming to when you can’t have a bit of friendly banter with passengers?’The sign reads: ’Please can drivers be aware that some of our customers may take offence at having terms such as "love", "darling" and "babe" directed towards them.’This can be seen by some as being a sexist comment, as a recent complaint has highlighted.’Managing director Roger French said: ’A lady complained to us that she thought the language used by a driver was demeaning to her.’We take a lot of customer feedback so we thought we would pass this on. The drivers will understand and take it in good spirit.’
