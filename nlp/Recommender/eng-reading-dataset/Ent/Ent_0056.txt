Swift makes return
After what seems like forever, Taylor Swift is finally back with new music.Her comeback song Look What You Made Me Do has broken three records in its first week of release, according to The Guardian.The 27-year-old’s first single since 2014 was released on Aug 25 with an accompanying lyric video.According to the BBC, the song was streamed over 10 million times on the day of its release, more than any other song has achieved in a single day.The video also broke YouTube’s one-day streaming record. It received more than 39 million views in 24 hours, smashing the record set by Adele, whose video for Hello was watched 27.7 million times on its first day.But while the song seems popular with fans, it’s received mixed reviews from critics.Spin magazine called the track “hard” and “cheerless”, while The New York Times described its lyrics as “powerful, yet joyless”.“‘I don’t trust nobody, and nobody trusts me’ is just one of many lyrics that present a darker, angrier version of the pop star’”, commented Vanity Fair.According to Forbes magazine, the pop singer has ditched the style that initially made her a household name. “The song’s intro makes it sound like this will be yet another fairy tale—the kind that she has sung so many times before—but nothing could be further from the truth. After a few seconds, it becomes clear that this is not the Taylor we have all come to know and love (or hate). “The song’s words, said the Daily Mail, contain an obvious reference  to US celebrity couple Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, with whom Swift has feuded.According to The Guardian, Look What You Made Me Do is the first song taken from Swift’s upcoming album, Reputation, which will be released in November.
