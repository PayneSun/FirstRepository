The doctors are in
With TV series The Young Doctor, director Zhao Baogang has again created a buzz among viewers. The medical drama is set in an emergency room and focuses on the various critical issues faced by the room’s physicians and staff, as well as the relationships between the doctors, nurses and patients.The story revolves around three interns and their watchful mentors. Day in and day out they rush between operating tables and go all out to save lives. But sometimes no matter how skillful a doctor is, they are still powerless when confronting life and death.In one case, an 83-year-old woman who is heavily asthmatic is dying. Without rescue measures, she may die in minutes. However, intubation would bring severe pain to the patient and might not even bring her life back. None of her seven daughters is willing to make that crucial decision, and while they pass the buck, the mother leaves for good.Similar highly emotional scenes and ethical dilemmas are not rare in this series. The producers intend to trigger thinking about hospice care, and their ideas are conveyed through doctor Ouyang Yulu’s words: “In the last course of life, what a person needs is not cold machines, but care from families.”Just as in Zhao’s other popular works, My Youthfulness, Struggle and Never Close the Eye, The Young Doctor also portrays the lives of young people with romantic relationships serving as an indispensable element.Cheng Jun (Ren Zhong), a resident physician who follows in his parents’ footsteps, has a crush on his colleague Ouyang (Zhang Li), but the female doctor is not ready to accept him. Shen Qingchuan’s (Zhang Duo) time in the emergency department strengthens their rescue capabilities, and also gets the three involved in a love triangle.Besides, the humorous dialogue and Beijing dialect of the main characters also makes the drama more attractive to young audiences.Although critics are harsh toward some inaccurate details such as the concentration of saline and misplacing of an echometer, the show has done well to show young doctors’ sincere devotion to their careers.
