Behind the superhero
When it comes to the character of Spider-Man, it’s easy to forget that behind this brave superhero is Peter Parker, a regular teenager. Spider-Man may be known for his bravery, strength, and crime-fighting skills but he still has to do his homework after he’s finished saving the world.In the latest reboot (重启) of the Marvel superhero franchise (品牌), Spider-Man: Homecoming, which came out in China on Sept 8, Parker is someone most of us can relate to, whatever our age. He’s a nervous high school sophomore (二年级学生), unsure of himself both inside and outside of school.Unlike regular superheroes, Spider-Man is often shown failing. The approach of having this young hero fail often is a bit of a gamble (赌博), because we’re used to seeing our superheroes succeed more often than not. But here, the young superhero experiences more missteps than successes, crashing (冲撞) into buildings and trees as many times as he defeats bad guys.But despite his mistakes, Parker’s always ready to take on the world, as we can see in the movie’s many fight scenes.It’s in these battles (战斗) that Parker/Spider-Man has both high and low moments, covering evildoers (恶人) with webs one moment, then getting dragged behind a truck the next.The main villain in the story is a flying criminal known as Vulture, who’s as dangerous as he is unusual. But even as Parker/Spider-Man gets pulled deeper into his battle against his new biggest enemy, he’s also stumbling (蹒跚行进) through problems in his personal life at high school. There, he’s not a hero, but a nerd (书呆子); made fun of by guys he could easily throw across the football field if he wanted to.Many of the situations Parker finds himself in are humorous – even many of the action scenes – filling the movie with many “real” moments. In many ways, however, this latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise is targeted (瞄准) at a younger audience, for whom the trials of high school life will seem all too familiar.
