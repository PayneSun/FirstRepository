Marvelously entertaining
Not only is The Avengers the superhero movie we had to have. It is the superhero movie we have to see. “This truly epic action picture positively pulses with panache, wit and excitement throughout,” said a review by The Hollywood Reporter.Upcoming Hollywood blockbusters such as The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man had better be at the peak of their powers to match this absolute blast – The Avengers, which is to be released on May 5.The Avengers marks the culmination of a long-range plan by Marvel Entertainment to transform their elite stable of comic-book crime fighters into box-office superstars.After achieving massive success with movies devoted to each one of the superheroes: Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, the time has come to get these big guns firing as one. That’s the major fun of the movie: seeing these characters joined together as one fighting force.In The Avengers, the all-star ensemble must thwart a possible world-ending scheme devised by Thor’s villainous brother Loki.In bringing their blood feud to Earth, the warring sibling gods have left open a mystical door that puts the entire mortal world in danger.The story of saving the world is one people have seen time and again, but when placed in the assured hands of such an A-list cast, it makes perfectly compelling sense.In particular, Robert Downey Jr is back in ripping form after a lackluster display in Iron Man 2. He supplies an infectious comic spark that lights up plenty of interplay between the egocentric major players.The welcome inclusion of Jeremy Renner as rogue marksman Hawkeye also prevents the movie from ever slipping into a rut.Before the film was made, the question was how could those characters, who have been around for more than half a century in about 500 comic book issues, not bore the audience, and more importantly, fit together.“The Avengers should never have worked. Too many characters, too many egos, and an inexperienced director,” The New York Times movie critic A.O. Scott wrote in his review.However, Scott admitted that director Joss Whedon has done a good job, by managing to stir all the personalities and ingredients together.“The resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again,” Scott said.“That it works and it’s as satisfying a tent-pole movie as you could hope for, is something close to a miracle.”
