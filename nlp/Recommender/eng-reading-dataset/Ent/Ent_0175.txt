Wartime romance
Here’s a quiz for diehard fans of South Korean soaps: In a 16-episode romance drama, which episode would most likely showcase a breakthrough kiss between the two main characters?The answer is the eighth. Just look at My Love from the Star (《来自星星的你》) and The Heirs (《继承者们》) and the recent Yong-pal (《龙八夷》).But now things are changing. In the latest romance-drama, Descendants of the Sun (《太阳的后裔》), a handsome soldier Yoo Shi-jin (Song Joong-ki) meets the pretty doctor Kang Mo-yeon (Song Hye-kyo) in a hospital, and he doesn’t hesitate to hit on her.“There is a clinic in the army, right?” she asks as she stitches his bullet-pierced flesh.Undeterred, he stares into her eyes. “May I come here?” he asks.“Isn’t this too far?”“It is. May I come every day? Will you be my doctor?”The dialogue, which takes place early in the first episode, immediately indicates that this is no ordinary South Korean drama. There’s no family feud, or secret crush, or love tangles, or guesses and misunderstandings. The 16-episode show is set in the fictional war-torn country of Uruk. Song Joong-ki is the leader of a special warfare command unit, while Song Hye-kyo plays a doctor who works for a humanitarian medical organization. Both are sent in the midst of disaster and disease as part of their work with UN peacekeeping troops. Both know and show clearly what they want and what they hate.But what stands out the most are Song’s skills as a pick-up artist.Boldness and creativity are the key weapons in his arsenal. When Kang invites Yoo to drink wine with her, Yoo, who is not allowed to drink alcohol as a soldier, says, “There is a way” before kissing her. Forget about the “eighth-episode rule”. This kiss happens in the fourth.Humor also does the trick. On their first date in a cinema, Yoo says, “This is the most exciting moment of my life. The moment I am with a beautiful woman before the theater lights go out.” When Kang tries to give Yoo a hard time, Yoo jokes, “I mistook you for a beautiful woman because it’s dark.”And actor Song Joong-ki, who just came back from two years of military service last May, makes sure he delivers his pick-up lines just right.“In Deep Rooted Tree (《树大根深》) and The Innocent Man (《善良的男人》), he [Song Joong-ki] showed he had the steel to play fearless and heartless men – that he could be taken seriously as an actor, despite his pretty face. In Descendants, he hits the emotional core of every scene, whether he has to be bold and amorous, guarded and mysterious, or sad,” said critic Foong Woei Wan in The Straits Times.
