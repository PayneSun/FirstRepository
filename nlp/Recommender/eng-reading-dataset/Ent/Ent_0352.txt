Hot debut for 5SOS
It’s Australia’s turn to enjoy the spotlight. Next in line for the teen heartthrob throne are four Australian teenagers with coiffed hair called 5 Seconds of Summer, or 5SOS.The proof is in the numbers: their She Looks So Perfect EP nearly overtook Disney animation Frozen’s soundtrack on the Billboard album chart when it debuted in the US on April 1, landing at No 2 and selling 143,000 copies in its first week, according to Billboard magazine.Across social media, the pop-punk rockers have amassed 2.4 million Facebook “likes”, 11 million Twitter followers and 20 million YouTube views for their hit single She Looks So Perfect lyric and music videos, according to USA Today.They boast passionate, numerous fans who snatched up tickets to the band’s first North American headlining tour, a 10-date visit that sold out in less than five minutes in February.The band members — Calum Hood, 18, Luke Hemmings, 17, and Michael Clifford, 18 — played music together as schoolmates in a Sydney suburb, drawing fans with YouTube covers of songs by the likes of Chris Brown and Justin Bieber.After booking their first gig, they realized they needed a drummer. So Clifford reached out to his friend Ashton Irwin, 19, on Facebook and said they’d be playing to more than 200 people.“We went onstage and there were 12 people there,” Hood told USA Today.But it is still Irwin’s favorite show to date. He said: “It was so new to us. It was a terrible gig, but there was just something about it that me and the boys loved. We knew it was the start of something cool for us.”Keeping cool headsAlthough they play their own instruments and don’t dance, the band is frequently lumped into the “boy band” category.“We didn’t really realize we were a boy band until people started calling us a boy band,” Irwin says. “I understand and we don’t care what people call us, as long as we’re making the music we love.”Being dubbed the next global superstars, there is some pressure on them, but the boys are focusing on seizing the day and not worrying about the future.“You always feel a bit of pressure,” Hood says. “The boys and I have high expectations of what we want to achieve, but we’re really just having fun at the moment and taking it day by day.”
