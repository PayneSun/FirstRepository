Home far away from home
In our summer guide last issue, we talked about hitchhiking, a way of traveling that is gaining popularity among young people in China. But for hitchhikers and backpackers, accommodation is also an important link on their adventure — and can consume much of the budget.Finding a hostel is a great solution, especially if it’s part of an organization, such as the YHA (Youth Hostels Association). Not only are they cheap, they’re also a meeting place for budget travelers from all over the world.
