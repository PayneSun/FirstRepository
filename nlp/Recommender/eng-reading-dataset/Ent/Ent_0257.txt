Back from the dead
Zombies have become very serious business over the years. Legions of video games, movies and television shows have all tried their best to use the undead to say something profound about the living, to mixed results.Based on an ongoing DC Comics series, “iZombie” waves off all that self-seriousness and instead embraces the inherent goofiness of its subject matter with open arms, and the result is a show that’s funny and addictive.Olivia “Liv” Moore (Rose McIver) was once a promising young medical student with a bright future, dedicated fiancé and supportive family. But after being attacked at a boat party, she washes up on a beach zombified and hungry for brains (and instant noodles), her bright future suddenly darkened.In order to keep her flesh-eating-monster instincts in check, Liv drops out of medical school and takes a job at a morgue, where she can feed on brains in secret and, just barely, live. When she discovers eating brains allows her to inherit the traits of the deceased and experience flashbacks of their last moments before dying, she uses her abilities to help the local police department solve murders.It’s an over-the-top setup in keeping with the show’s over-the-top sensibilities. The creators spend no time justifying their approach, and that’s for the best. This is a series where you’re just going to have to go with the flow.Each episode plays out like a quirkier version of the average crime drama: There’s a crime, there’s an investigation, there’s a twist, and then the mystery is solved. What makes “iZombie” different is that it employs this formula not to shock audiences with the grittiness of police work, but as a vehicle to push along Liv’s development as a character.As Liv solves crimes and takes on new personality traits, she gradually discovers she has the power to cope with what she’s become and deal with the unfair obstacles fate has placed before her.“Izombie” is a story about unexpected reinvention, and it’s never been more fun watching a zombie come back to life.
