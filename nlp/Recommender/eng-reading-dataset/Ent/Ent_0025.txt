‘Big Bang’ wedding
It’s hard to imagine a woman who could survive spending the rest of her life with Sheldon Cooper, one of the main characters of The Big Bang Theory. As a man of science, Cooper would probably rather devote all his time to scientific studies and pop culture pastimes than develop a romantic relationship.But in the 11th season finale of the popular US sitcom, the nerdy and socially awkward man ties the knot with his equally nerdy and brilliant love, Amy Fowler. It aired on May 10.On the wedding, Fowler tells Cooper that as a neurobiologist, she’s worked on research that was against love at first sight, but when she first met him in a coffee shop, she knew there was something special between them.Sheldon then says in return, “I’m overwhelmed by you, in a good way,” adding, “Even if I can’t tell you now how I feel, I will spend my life showing you how much I love you.”
