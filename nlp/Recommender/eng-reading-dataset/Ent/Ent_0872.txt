First Lady of British fashion
Her innate sense of style has propelled Samantha Cameron to the top of Vanity Fair’s best dressed list.Now the British Fashion Council is to harness some of that SamCam glam in its efforts to promote the UK fashion industry.Downing Street confirmed today that the Prime Minister’s wife will be working as an adviser for London Fashion Week from next February.Mrs Cameron, who has been absent from many of this week’s shows following the birth of her daughter Florence, will take an informal, unpaid role working with the British Fashion Council, using No. 10 as a showcase for the country’s design talent.She said: ’London Fashion Week is extremely important to the fashion industry in the UK and I look forward to being fully involved from next season.’We have so much young talent that needs to be supported and nurtured to ensure we are building brands and businesses for the future.’Mrs Cameron, 39, stepped down from her position as creative director of luxury stationer Smythson earlier this year, after her husband became Prime Minister. She is planning to return to work for the company two days a week as a consultant. British Fashion Council chief executive Caroline Rush said: ’We are delighted that Samantha has agreed to play a role in helping us grow and develop London Fashion Week and know how much she will contribute with her considerable experience and creative sensibility.’BFC chairman Harold Tillman said: ’She is going to facilitate events and functions at Downing Street. She will be the person she really is - she’s got great fashion sense, dresses very well and she has great taste.’She will host Downing Street receptions, probably wear clothes by young British designers and be involved in charity fundraising.’As soon as London Fashion Week is over we will sit down and decide exactly what the role entails.’Since her husband became leader of the Tory party, and later Prime Minister, Mrs Cameron has found herself under the fashion spotlight.
