How to watch documentaries
Last year, A Bite of China, made by CCTV’s Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs.Silk Road: The Journey Goes On, a new CCTV documentary about traveling the ancient road, just finished broadcasting last month and, again, received critical acclaim.When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn’t necessarily know about.So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries.Pay attention to the themesWhile watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on.The themes of a documentary can go a long way in telling you its purpose, which in turn provides strong preliminary hints as to the legitimacy of the information you’re getting. Is it meant to be informative or provoke a certain emotional response?Think criticallyListen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating a point with someone or trying to accurately introduce a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense?Check the sourcesIf you’re sitting at the computer and can’t think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read about the people that were interviewed in the documentary to see if they had any concealed motives for appearing in it.Who are the creators?The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama’s America was directed in large part by conservative writer Dinesh D’Souza, it’s not surprising that it’s critical of President Obama at the outset. Similarly, Blackfish, which was partially backed by CNN, is sympathetic to the plight of the killer whales.
