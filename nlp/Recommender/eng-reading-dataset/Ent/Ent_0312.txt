Pulled TV drama replays after removing revealing images
A Chinese television drama that was pulled off the air for "technical reasons" after the characters were shown in revealing clothing is now back on TV showing only the actor’s heads.The drama, "The Empress of China" also known as the "Saga of Wu Zetian", highlights the life of China’s only known empress. It began broadcasting on Dec. 21, 2014, but was removed a week later by commercial satellite station Hunan TV for "technical reasons."Many viewers speculated the suspension was a punishment given by the country’s television regulators for the much-discussed revealing costumes of female characters on the show, which stirred online debate in which the female characters were dubbed "squeezed breasts."The show began to air once again on last Thursday, but with edited scenes that show only the character’s heads.The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television has not responded to inquiries.Web users complained the edited version only has close-ups of the character’s faces, greatly affecting the composition and plot.However, some supported the cut."I can hardly look at the TV as there are so many breasts..." wrote "Jingjingmi-ko" on microblog Sina Weibo.Wu Zetian, the only recorded empress of China, was concubine of Emperor Taizong in Tang Dynasty. After Emperor Taizong’s death, Wu married his successor Emperor Gaozong.After Emperor Gaozong’s stroke, Wu ruled the country in her own right.
