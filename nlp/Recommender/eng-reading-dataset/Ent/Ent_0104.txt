Social media’s new statuesque sensation
A visit to the White House to meet the US President and first lady is usually a formal affair. But when Lebron James and his NBA championship-winning Cleveland Cavaliers were invited, things didn’t follow tradition.A video uploaded to social media shows the teammates in various poses in a room in the White House, while the camera pans across each seemingly-frozen player for what seems like an *eternity. The clip even shows James posing with Michelle Obama as if they were taking a *selfie together.To the *uninitiated eye it appears that time is standing still, or that the players are not even real. But those who use social media should recognize this setup as the latest craze that’s sweeping the web.The Mannequin Challenge is the newest addition to a list that includes the Harlem Shake, the Ice Bucket Challenge and Planking. Celebrities like Adele and Britney Spears, as well as almost every professional sporting team, have all joined in the fun.And like most *viral trends, it was a bored US teenager who started it.“One day my friend walked to the front of the class and just stood there, so me and my friend joined her and started doing crazy poses,” 16-year-old Jasmine Cavins, a high school student from Florida, told the New York Post. “My friend was like: ‘We can make this a challenge’.”After Cavin’s video was posted to Twitter, star power soon took over to bring the craze to its current level of fame. “I think I realized [it was popular] when Beyonce did one,” Cavins said.Unlike the Ice Bucket Challenge, which was intended to raise money and awareness for motor neuron disease, the Mannequin Challenge is done purely in the name of fun.Yet where the similarity in the two viral sensations lies is the manner in which a group “challenges” another.Kevin Allocca, YouTube’s head of culture and trends, said that sort of “one-upmanship” appeals to people – particularly teenagers and anyone looking to bolster their social media presence – but it’s the challenge’s simplicity that’s the biggest drawer.“You can do it at your home, you can do it in a TV studio, but at the same time add your own kind of creative take to it,” he told the New York Post.However, The Guardian’s Arwa Mahdawi believes timing is the reason for the Mannequin Challenge’s popularity.“The fact that being quiet and still has been so enthusiastically embraced by everyone from high schoolers to *imminent presidents is a sign, I feel, that we are all very, very tired and we would like a little rest, please,” Mahdawi wrote. “It’s worth remembering that there’s nothing wrong with doing nothing every now and then.”
