Confident queen
It seems the Grammy Awards just don’t favor Katy Perry – the US singer and songwriter has been nominated 13 times for her music without ever taking home a prize. But Twitter users and music lovers obviously don’t see eye-to-eye with the award committee.In 2013 Perry became the most followed person on Twitter and, with nearly 70 million followers today, she still reigns supreme.In an interview with USA Today she shared her secrets to successfully managing social media, giving tips such as “don’t use it just to promote yourself”, “don’t be self-*indulgent” and “ignore your haters”.Perry isn’t just friendly with her fans online, she also makes connections with them in the real world.This month, the 30-year-old pop star brought her Prismatic World Tour to Guangzhou and Shanghai. Tickets were sold out shortly after they went on sale online.The artist gave her all to meet fans’ high expectations, belting through a selection of her most popular hits including “Roar”, style Teenage Dream and Firework. She even invited fans to come up on stage to teach her to say “I love you” in Chinese and “Fruit Sister”, as she is called by many Chinese fans, making her screaming fans even crazier.On social media, Perry doesn’t fight back against every rumor or criticism directed her way. Her music, which stands as her foothold in the business, also keeps her style consistent. She sticks to herself and pays no attention to anyone who says otherwise.Perry first made her entrance into the music biz in 2008 with her hit single I Kissed a Girl, and she came to international fame with the multi-platinum album Teenage Dream in 2010. Unwilling to join the ranks of the average pop-rock idols, Perry developed a controversial style featuring colorful dresses and straightforward lyrics.With her latest album Prism (2013), she’s developed a “cooler” and “more sophisticated” style, as she told global lifestyle magazine Elle. In Roar, a musical autobiography about her transformation from a passive girl into a woman who can stand on her own two feet, she stresses self-empowerment and self-esteem.In a conversation with USA Today, Perry offered up this observation: “If you tried to please everyone, you’d have no sense of self. You’d lose yourself in the process of being a people-pleaser and there’d be nothing unique left.”
