The road to true love
It will be of little comfort to the woman who has just had her heart broken for the second time.But the next man she falls for could well be ‘the one’.The average woman will suffer heartbreak twice before she meets the man of her dreams, according to a study.She will also kiss 15 men and enjoy two long-term relationships.The research suggests that before settling down, a woman will go on four disastrous dates and be stood up once. But she will also have fallen in love twice, lived with one partner and had four one-night stands.Men, on the other hand, face being stood up twice and will have six one-night stands before they meet their ideal partner. This figure could be coming down, though, because a separate study suggests that men are becoming less afraid of commitment.They also want to settle down at a younger age than a decade ago, a survey of 2,000 adults by dating site eHarmony found.The average young man is ready for a committed relationship from the age of 22, two years younger than ten years ago.One in four single men questioned said they wanted a committed relationship so they could start a family, while a fifth worried that they would be ‘left on the shelf’ while their friends were paired off.But before they settle down men will enjoy eight dates with different women, as well as three blind dates and meet three people over the internet, according to the study of loved-up Brits who have already met the one.By comparison, women will date seven men, not including two blind dates and two dates with someone they meet online. The study also revealed that men will have six relationships, of which two will last more than a year, while women will have five.Men and women both face getting cheated on once in their quest to find the one – but the average adult will also be the cheater on at least one occasion in their dating lifetime.It also emerged that almost six in ten Brits once reached a point where they felt they were never going to find that special someone.Eight in ten said they met the one when they least expected it, while more than a quarter said their current partner wasn’t the type of person they thought they would settle down with.Researchers also found that while 94 per cent of women believe in true love, just 88 per cent of men feel the same way.
