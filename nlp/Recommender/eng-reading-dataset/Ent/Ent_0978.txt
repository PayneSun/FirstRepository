Peking 'Oprah' shares limelight
The Oprah Winfrey Show added Chen Luyu to its list of famous co-hosts from around the world when the two talk show queens hooked up via satellite for the first time on Aug 26. "I was on Oprah’s talk show because the world is focusing on China," says Chen, who was the first Asian host invited by Winfrey.Chen took Winfrey and her US audience on a tour through her office, studio and dressing room as well as offering a special guided tour around Beijing’s famous Houhai area and the capital’s popular 798 art district.Winfrey was surprised about Chen’s most memorable interviews including HIV victims and lesbian couples."Chinese people have a wide understanding about Western countries, but it is not the other way around, which causes misunderstanding," Chen says. "I have interviewed more than 3,000 guests who come from various classes and working backgrounds. They tell their stories and my audience shows great respect."Known as "China’s Oprah", the 39-year-old TV personality decided to model her show, A Date With Luyu, on the Winfrey’s iconic show after visiting the US more than a decade ago."It is flattering to be called China’s Oprah, which means people say ’you are really good’," she says."I am curious and ask some tough questions. But I tend to be protective of my guests. If they don’t want to answer those questions, that’s fine."Over the past 10 years of being a public face in a rapidly changing China, she has gone from interviewing celebrities to talking with people from all walks of life.Her guests share their story with a live audience of 300 and a viewing audience of more than 60 million every day."It has become more than a show," Chen says. "Chinese audiences tend to be shy. I cannot expect my viewers to act like those on Oprah’s show, who would shout and scream," she says."But Chinese audiences can respond to the interviewees’ stories and show me their smiles and tears."Chen’s daily chat show is on Phoenix satellite television station, the first foreign-funded station to be beamed into the mainland.Winfrey was surprised by Chen’s high ratings and expressed a desire to visit China and be a guest on Chen’s talk show."The cooperation enables Western audiences to know more about China. And I think that Chinese talk shows can be as vibrant as any other country," Chen says.
