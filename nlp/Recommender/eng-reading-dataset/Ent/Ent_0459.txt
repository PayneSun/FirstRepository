Australia’s Next Top Model
The 16-year-old Melbourne school girl was crowned the winner of the 2013 series in front of a crowd of screaming fans.During the show, the teen was seen placing seven fingers lined up consecutively on her forehead to demonstrate its uncharacteristic depth.Juratowitch’s proud mother said her daughter’s large forehead had always been an “issue” for her growing up, but she now couldn’t be prouder to see her daughter use her quirk to her advantage.Juratowich beat fellow Melbourne teens Nyadak ‘Duckie’ Thot and Shanali Martin for the title.Judge Charlotte Dawson described Juratowitch’s unique appearance as “like an alien doll” and “so arresting”.“She has a unique look and her face is that extraordinary that nothing else seems to matter,” Dawson added.In a bizarre twist, the 16-year-old Top Model winner never planned to audition in the first place, believing that she didn’t have what it takes to be a model.“I went to support a friend and had no intention of auditioning. The next thing I knew, I was on stage,” she said.“I never thought I could even be a model, so to win feels amazing.I can’t believe it, I can’t fathom what is going on right now,” she said as she was crowned the winner by host Jennifer Hawkins.The shortest model of the series, judge Alex Perry - who is renowned for his love of extremely tall models - said Juratowich’s unique features outweighed her need for height. “It was the first time I said a model’s height didn’t matter,” he said.Juratowitch has been immediately signed to IMG models and will appear on the cover of Harpers Bazaar, which hits shelves on October 7.
