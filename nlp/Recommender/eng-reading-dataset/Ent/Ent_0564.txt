Far from miserable
Although it’s been adapted for the big screen dozens of times over the past few decades, the latest version of Les Misérables is perhaps the most highly anticipated yet.Directed by British director Tom Hooper, fresh from sweeping the board at the Oscars with The King’s Speech, the movie-musical stars the likes of Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe. It seems success is already all but guaranteed.Some might be skeptical due to the lack of quality movie musicals in recent years. But according to Marlow Stern, movie critic for The Daily Beast, who attended the movie’s world premiere in New York last week, Les Misérables proved doubters wrong. “It hits all the right notes and is, in my opinion, the newly minted frontrunner for the Best Picture Oscar,” Stern wrote in his review.From filming the movie through to its early promotion, Hathaway undoubtedly caught the most attention, mainly due to the haircut and weight loss required for her role.However, what may have been even more challenging for Hathaway and her fellow actors was the singing. Hooper decided to have the entire cast sing all the songs live during filming, with live musical accompaniment. The performers had nine weeks of rehearsal to get their vocals in shape and it shows onscreen, as each and every song is brimming with pathos.“I was re-watching classic musicals and I must admit I struggled watching the movie musicals where people are lip-syncing,” Hooper said in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly. “There’s a distancing quality to it, which I don’t quite like.”Nearly every song in the film is brilliantly performed, with highlights including Hathaway’s I Dreamed a Dream (after her first client), and Jackman’s rendition of What Have I Done (following his theft).Jackman, who has a background playing in musicals, seems to be at his best in period dramas and does a fine job capturing Valjean’s brutish exterior and inner turmoil.The mid-19th century, a time of social and political upheaval in Europe and the US, is very topical at the moment. There’s Lincoln, Spielberg’s historical epic chronicling the passage of the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery; another film adaptation of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations; and The Dark Knight Rises, which was inspired by the Dickens classic, A Tale of Two Cities.As for Les Misérables, it is “one of the most joyous, epic experiences you’ll have in a cinema this year”, according to Stern.“Once again it proves that the director’s Oscar-winning previous effort, The King’s Speech, was no fluke.”
