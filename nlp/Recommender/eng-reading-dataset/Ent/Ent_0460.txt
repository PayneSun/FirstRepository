Meet Mr Incredibeard
One bearded man has truly earned his namesake by proving his incredible beard with weekly pictures.Isaiah Webb - dubbed Incredibeard - has grown his facial fuzz to large proportions, allowing him to style it into unique designs.Facial hair enthusiast Webb, 29, of San Francisco, is ’a simple man with an extraordinary mission’, hoping to creatively transform his impressive facial fuzz into into bizarre works of art.He posts pictures of his sculpted facial hair on Tumblr and Instagram every Monday. Each week, fans write in with crazy suggestions on how to style his beard.This has resulted in some crazy styles including constructing a bowl for his ramen - dubbedthe Big Bowl O’Beard Ramen (one of his personal favourites) - and crafting five beer cup holders beneath his chin.In an interview with Mashable, Incredibeard admits that he hasn’t been clean-shaven in about 15 years, but only really began growing his beard out 18 months ago.The decorative displays are each designed by Webb himself and styled by his wife, Aphan. In fact, it was his wife who urged him to grow his beard and pursue this unusual undertaking.’[My wife] was really the one that kept pushing me to grow a beard, then to grow it out long. She is at the heart of Incredibeard,’ Incredibeard tells Mashable.’I may come up with the different beard design ideas, but she is the one that styles everything. She brings the beard art to life. Incredibeard would be nothing without her.’
