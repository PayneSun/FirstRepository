Award sees Tse grow up
When Nicolas Tse accepted the Best Actor *trophy at the Hong Kong Film Awards he thanked his father, the *veteran actor Patrick Tse, for tolerating his *rebellious behavior.Tse went on: “I hope you forgive the rude kid who had no judgment. “To raise such a troublesome kid and still face the public with a smile, you are the real best actor dad. I’m sorry.”Tse, 30, has transformed himself from *brash pop star to serious actor. He once saw his career *derailed by criminal charges after a car accident. He’s also famous for his bad-boy, trouble-making image.Now a father-of-two, the star has learnt to be responsible and modest.At the scene, he recalled the award ceremony 12 years ago: after being named Best Newcomer the *arrogant 18-year-old Tse “*scorned” his dad.Finally he got his chance to apologize. Tse won this award for playing a reluctant *informant in the police thriller The Stool Pigeon. Tse, the youngest of five nominees for Best Actor, is known for doing risky *stunts. He says he won’t stop being a *daredevil. “That’s my *devotion to filmmaking,” he said.Besides acting, Tse says he wants to produce “Hong Kong made” films. The film legend Chou Yun-fat (周润发) says that rising actors like Tse represent the future of the Hong Kong movie industry.Chou said to Tse: “You are so young and ambitious, so the next 30 years of Hong Kong films will rest on your shoulders!”
