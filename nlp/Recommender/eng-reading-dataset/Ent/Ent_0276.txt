Wild Tales’ obsession with revenge
We’ve all lost control in the face of injustice. “Wild Tales” puts every character in this situation and tries to dig out their wildest side.This 2014 film from Argentine screenwriter and director Damián Szifron, which was shown at the Beijing International Film Festival (April 16-23), intrigued audiences with its off-kilter humor and unexpected plotline.The film consists of six unrelated stories, each varying in style but sharing the same theme: vengeance.The first story, “Pasternak”, takes place on a plane where a model and a music critic suddenly notice they both know the pilot – Pasternak – during casual conversation.When another passenger and an airline stewardess chime in, they gradually realize this is not a coincidence but is rather premeditated revenge.It’s natural that some segments are better than others in multi-story films. The standout in “Wild Tales” is the final story, “Until Death Do Us Part”.The story starts with love and celebration on a couple’s wedding day. Things soon go awry, however, when the bride finds out her groom has cheated and bitter retaliation erupts.But just as the audience expects a drastic split between the two, the story comes to a surprise ending.It feels like watching an arrow deviate direction the moment the bowstring is released. Suddenly, as it approaches the target, the arrow veers back on track in an inconceivable curve.Most audiences would likely describe the film as a mordant black comedy with hard-to-believe scenes and hysterical characters.Szifron told The Associated Press in an interview that inspiration for the film came from his personal experiences.“So there’s something in the middle and I would say that is the pleasure of reaction toward injustice, toward abuse of power, of letting your instincts drive your behavior. There’s a particular moment in which all characters cross lines and they enjoy it and we do as well,” Szifron told NPR.In other words, art imitates and dramatizes life, and then finally expresses our hope for it.
