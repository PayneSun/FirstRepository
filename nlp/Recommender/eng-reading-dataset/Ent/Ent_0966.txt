Shanghai to purge itself of ‘Chinglish’
Shanghai does not want to lose face over the mistranslations and mistakes when thousands of visitors arrive for the World Expo next year. Teams of student volunteers have been assembled to scour the city for Chinglish and a website will shortly be launched to collect complaints, according to the city’s Language Work Committee.The news will dismay many English-speaking residents, who have developed a fondness for the city’s quirky signs. At the Pearl Tower, one of Shanghai’s most famous attractions, a sign forbids "ragamuffin, drunken people and psychotic" from entering. Further instructions include: "Prohibit carrying animals and the articles which disturb common sanitation (including the peculiar smell of effluvium)" and a ban on "dangerous germs, pests and other baleful biology".Meanwhile, on the city’s subway system, signs such as: "If you take the phone on your waistband, as if to send money to the thief" or "If you are stolen, call the police at once" are likely to vanish forever. Although public signs can be easily altered, there remains some doubt over whether officials can contain the spread of Chinglish among private businesses. Some stores boast that they are "Cellular telephone is monopolied" while a problem using a computer translationZhang Ripei, an official on the Language Work Committee, said Chinglish signs were "degrading" to the image of businesses in the city. He mentioned one hotel near Shanghai’s Hongqiao airport which anglicised its name into "Hang You Hotel".However, he said the new rules, contained in a ten-volume guide, would not be mandatory and there would be no punishment for firms that refused to correct their signage.One of the organisers of a student team, who named himself as Mr Yang, said: "I think it’s necessary to follow the standard norms, especially on public signs so that there is no confusion for first time visitors."The Chinglish signs are sometimes quite endearing to Shanghai people, but for visitors, especially foreign guests, they can be quite misleading."Astonished Chinglish：Four Glad Meat balls Wash after relief Chickens That Did Not Have Sexual ExperienceYou ask me，me ask who？Horse horse tiger tiger.
