Float away from life’s stresses
Are you bored with doing chores? Wouldn’t you like to fly away to escape your worries? Well, try “levitation” or floating in the air. Escaping gravity means casting off your chains.Float through a railway station, hover over a closed factory, and hang suspended in the night sky. These all sound like surrealistic, dreamy scenes from fiction.But those up-in-the-air images have appeared online thanks to Japanese girl, Natsumi Hayashi. Hayashi, an artist’s assistant in Tokyo, started a craze. She became popular after she posted photos of herself levitating on her blog called “Yowa Yowa Camera Woman Diary”. She describes her artwork as a way of relieving the pressures of daily life and finding a sense of freedom.“I struggle with personal relationships and daily stresses,” Hayashi told Japan Realtime, an online news service. “In art I want to be free from the earth’s gravitational pull. I am also not bound by social conventions.”Her idea has struck a chord with Chinese youths. Inspired by Hayashi, Chinese “levitation girl” Cong Lin, 24, posted photos of herself levitating in Ditan Park, Beijing. They became an instant hit on Renren.com. Also, a male online user nicknamed “beard man” published pictures of himself floating over hutong in Beijing. Do they have unnatural superpowers? Hayashi revealed that she did it all with a professional camera and self-timer. Ready? Jump and click the button. You may fall, but your airborne moment will appear effortless. Want to try making your own levitation photos? You may need to jump 200 times in public. Don’t panic when you feel unbalanced. You’ll also have to put up with some weird looks. People may think you’re nuts. Hayashi gets it all the time. She explains that she’s shooting a wedding slide show.Looking fashionable helps. Cong’s black stockings and Hayashi’s leather boots add to their charm.Pick somewhere atmospheric. Pretend you are floating through doors or levitating from a chair.
