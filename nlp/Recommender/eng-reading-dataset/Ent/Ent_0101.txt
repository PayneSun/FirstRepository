Disney’s new princess
Merriam-Webster defines a princess as a “member of a royal family”, “the wife of a prince” or “usually an attractive girl or woman who is treated with special attention”.Nowhere in that traditional definition do the words “*spunk”, “drive” or “determination” appear. And yet the latest Walt Disney animation Moana seems determined to *redefine what a princess is all about.The last few *reincarnations of Disney princesses, beginning with the book-smart Belle and leading up to the *feisty Frozen sisters, all have the independent streak and desire to break out of the mold they were born into. However, all still had that handsome guy waiting in the wings to help save the day.In Moana, Disney’s latest movie provides a positive spin on the princess spirit. The CG (Computer Graphics) -animated musical film follows the adventures of the headstrong teenage daughter of a Pacific Island chief and her struggles to find her identity.As the daughter of Chief Tui, Moana is expected to follow her village’s traditions and rules, including the one her father has emphasized since she was an infant: “Don’t go beyond the reef.”Unfortunately for Moana – whose name just happens to be the word for “ocean” in many *Polynesian languages – she is drawn to the water, which she finds *wondrous and exciting.When the food supply for the island suddenly becomes depleted, Moana sets forth on a journey inspired by *ancestral tales of once-mighty *demigod Maui who may help her save her island home.The story, inspired by the history and traditions of the Pacific, is a breath of fresh ocean air for everyone exhausted by the too-familiar princess-on-a-mission Disney trope. From birth, Moana is a respected part of her community, and her parents and grandmother are proud of who she is and the fact that she will one day make a fantastic chief, just like her father and his father before him. There is no love interest for Moana – she doesn’t need one.Moana pays *homage to Pacific Islanders by introducing us to a strong female character unlike any we’ve seen in mainstream films – a hero who is both smart and *sympathetic, strong and compassionate, independent yet belongs to a group. For *eons, we’ve been bombarded by images of princesses based on the beauty standards of Europeans. Why not bring forth a new face for fierceness?More importantly, when mothers and fathers tell their daughters what it means to be a princess, the words “adventurous,” “*tenacious” and “compassionate” can now be added to the definition.
