Luckily, there are some outdoor activities which don’t involve breaking sweat.River raftingHot summer weather and cool water - what a perfect match. River *rafting can be both scenic and exciting. When the raft follows a gentle stream, the views of the countryside or valley is like a traditional Chinese painting. And when you enter white water where the riverbed creates a natural roller coaster, you feel a rush of *adrenaline. Paddle your raft to the riverbank to have a picnic or barbecue which will taste best when you are starving.Where to find: River rafting trips are usually on offer in mountainous or valley regions such as the Three Gorges.Tips: Wear a helmet and life jacket at all times; bring enough *sunscreen; and bring lots of water.CavingPeople say that the only naturally air-conditioned place in summer is a big cave.

With sea breezes in your hair, it is nice to take a hike or cycle ride while enjoying the coastline. If you want to be sportier, try beach games, such as soccer and volleyball. It’s a totally different experience from playing on hard courts or grass.Where to find: Just go to the beach or find an urban artificial beach such as the one in Chaoyang Park in Beijing or the man-made lake beach in Wuhan.Tips: Loads of sunscreen needed; water and snacks are necessary; be aware of jellyfish and garbage floating in the water. 21st
