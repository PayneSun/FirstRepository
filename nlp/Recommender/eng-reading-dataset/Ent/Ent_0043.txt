Eminem remains on top of charts
He has been called many things: brilliant, talented, shocking.After two decades at the center of international hip-hop and pop culture, Eminem, 45, continues to shine on with his storied career.Revival, which came out last month, debuted at No 1 in the UK. It was Eminem’s eighth No 1 album in the UK, though there had been little warning that a new album was coming as quickly as it did.Eminem is well-known for being able to tackle sensitive issues and has always had more than a little shock value. In his new album, the US rapper writes about his failed marriage, the racism he faces, the doubts he has about his own music, political problems in the United States and how he draws power from dark times.In fact, Eminem delivered an angry freestyle rap about US president Donald Trump at the Black Entertainment Television (BET) Hip-Hop Awards on Oct 6, calling Trump a “racist grandpa”. According to the Guardian, the rapper had previously thought that Trump might be a fresh voice in US politics, but his opinion completely changed after the then president-elect’s campaign speech in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as criminals.“He makes my blood boil. I can’t even watch the news anymore because it makes me too stressed out,” Eminem told Vulture magazine. “All jokes aside, all punch lines aside, I’m trying to get a message out there about him. I want our country to be great too, I want it to be the best it can be, but it’s not going to be that with him in charge.”
