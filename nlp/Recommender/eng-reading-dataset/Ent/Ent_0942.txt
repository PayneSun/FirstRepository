Tomb of legendary ruler unearthed
Legend has it that Cao Cao, King Wu of Wei kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period (AD 208 to 280), had built 72 tombs to thwart tomb raiders.Experts, however, have always doubted this, believing it was more a fabrication that reflected Cao’s political cunning as portrayed in the classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Now, they have come up with solid evidence to prove it wrong.Archaeological officials confirmed yesterday the discovery of Cao’s mausoleum in Xigaoxue, a village in Anyang county of Henan province, which, much to the surprise of many, was indeed built as austerely as recorded in historical archives."Excavation has been going on for nearly one year, and we’ll come up with further evidence. But even based on what we’ve got, we can tell for sure that the mausoleum belongs to Cao Cao," Guan Qiang, deputy director of the department of cultural heritage conservation at the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), told a briefing in Beijing. Experts also unearthed bones of three people, through which they identified their ages: One male of around 60, and two women, one in her 50s and the other between 20 and 25.Experts believe the male was Cao, the elder woman his empress who died in AD 230 and was buried at Cao’s tomb with her close companion, the younger woman.Over the past year, archaeologists have recovered more than 250 relics from the tomb that covers an area of 740 sq m. Among them are stone paintings featuring social life of Cao’s time, stone tablets bearing inscriptions of sacrificial objects, and Cao’s personal belongings bearing the inscription "personal belongings frequently used by King Wu of Wei" such as the one found on a stone pillow.It is also clear that the tomb was built and furnished austerely, which is in accordance with historical records saying Cao ordered his tomb to be built "on non-arable highland, with no (pyramid-shape) mound or any plantation upon it", and "no treasures of gold and jade in it".The fact that the tomb’s location is only a few kilometers from Yecheng (to the southwest of today’s Linzhang county, Hebei province), historically the political center of Wei kingdom, is also strong proof that it is Cao’s tomb, according to archaeologist Liu Qingzhu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.In Yecheng, Cao built the famous Bronze Sparrow Terrace, where musicians and dancers would perform to entertain guests at his banquets.Before his death, Cao left word he wanted his tomb to be built in a place where his children could see from the terrace anytime they remember him, or from where he, as a spirit in the underworld, could enjoy the performances on the terrace.Experts agree that excavation of the mausoleum has just started and further research and study would prove the historical importance of the discovery, considering the important role Cao played in history.
