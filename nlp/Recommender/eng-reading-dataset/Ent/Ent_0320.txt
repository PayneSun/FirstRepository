Don’t stop the music
Smartphone apps are a dime a dozen. Each day, dozens premiere on app stores worldwide, and by the next week, only a handful haven’t been left to collect dust in user’s app drawers. But an exception does exist — Cytus (《音乐节奏》), a cell phone game created by Taiwan-based company Rayark, has remained in the top three on the App Store for more than two years. How has it managed to do so, especially in a fluid industry where people constantly crave new thrills? Let’s check out the app to find out.If you’re familiar with Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero, then you should be no stranger to Cytus’ gameplay mechanisms. However, there are a few twists in this rhythm game. With most music games, the notes usually scroll toward a designated area where you must tap the notes in time. Cytus instead has a scan line traveling up and down the screen to match the tempo of the music. When the line passes through gray circular touch points, which gradually expand, flushing with color as they become active, you need to tap them or hold your finger down for longer notes. Occasionally you’ll be asked to follow a diagonal line of circles, dragging your digit through them as the line rises or falls.These twists aren’t what really make Cytus stand out. What matters the most is the core of the game — the music. Cytus consists of 90 free songs ranging from techno to J-pop. And as androidapps.com points out, “Cytus is like the Billboard’s Top 50 of J-pop”.According to developer Rayark, high quality original records were contributed by the likes of Japanese video game music composer Tsukasa Masuko and Japanese music producer naotyu- (full name Naoki Chiba).And even if J-pop is not your cup of tea, you can fully appreciate Cytus, because the songs themselves are energetic and well suited to this kind of game.
