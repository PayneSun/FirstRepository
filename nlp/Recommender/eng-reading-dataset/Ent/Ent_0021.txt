Journey of survival
Emilia Clarke is best known for her role as the powerful Daenerys Targaryen in HBO’s popular TV series Game of Thrones.But now, the 31-year-old UK actress has expanded her “skills” from training dragons to exploring galaxies. In the movie Solo: A Star Wars Story, which came out in Chinese mainland cinemas on May 25, she plays Qi’ra, a femme fatale with “a core of steel” that has a lot of influence on Han Solo, the famous hero in the Star Wars movie series.In the film, Qi’ra “gets to be badass, strong and has her own journey. Her journey is one of survival and strength”, Clarke revealed to Entertainment Weekly. “[Qi’ra and Han Solo] grew up as pals, as partners in crime.”The character seems to match Clarke’s standards of what a suitable character is. As she told Vogue magazine, her perfect roles are the ones that are “something juicy, something interesting, something with depth, something with a bit of substance”.
