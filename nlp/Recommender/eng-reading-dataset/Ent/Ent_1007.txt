Jet Li becomes Singapore citizen
Chinese action star Jet Li has taken up Singapore citizenship and bought a property in the city-state worth nearly 14 million dollars, AFP has reported.Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) would not confirm the newspaper report when contacted by AFP for reasons of confidentiality.A Beijing-based staff member at Li’s One Foundation contacted by AFP declined to comment.The Business Times said Li moved his family to Singapore in 2007 for his children’s education.Li is the latest Chinese star to have taken up Singapore citizenship, following in the footsteps of leading actress Gong Li.The news has sparked debate on whether the act is patriotic or not. The following are comments from netizens:For:Does changing citizenship mean a person is not Chinese any more? I think people who say it’s unpatriotic don’t understand. As long as he continues to keep his country in mind, I’ll love and support him forever!People who say he’s unpatriotic are not real Li fans. I’ll support Li and the One Foundation forever!It’s not nationality, it’s having a Chinese heart that matters. Even if he became a Martian I’d still love him.Against:We all love him, but that doesn’t mean we have to agree with everything he does. If he’s just doing this for his own convenience we can’t really call him patriotic.He’s just an actor. He may play heroes, but he’s not a real one. He’s overshadowed by Tsien Hsue-shen, who risked his life to come home.Jet Li plays heroes -- Wong Fei-hung, Fong Sai Yuk and Chen Zhen etc. They put national interest before their own interest. He was a symbol to China. But look at his behavior today. What he’s doing is really hurting our country.
