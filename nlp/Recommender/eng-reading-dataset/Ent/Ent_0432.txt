Everyone wants control
It’s bad luck getting involved in a crime without knowing why. So imagine how terrible it is to be controlled all the time without being able to break free.This is the premise of the new action thriller Control. The suspenseful vibe throughout its 90 minutes is enough to keep us on the edge of our seats.The unfortunate one here is Mark, played by Daniel Wu. Mark is an ordinary insurance salesman who commits perjury in order to help his sick mother. Soon he gets repeated calls from a mysterious man who threatens him and forces him to commit crimes such as robbing a bank. As Mark’s life gets more and more miserable, the game of identifying the tormentor begins.Set in a scientifically advanced, futuristic city, the first few minutes of the film not only pull us into the riddle, they also introduce us to various kinds of high-tech devices — something we don’t often see in Chinese films, especially not those by director Kenneth Bi, who is known for his work on romantic movies.As the story continues, we discover that Mark is not the only puppet. There are several others with whom he shares a wrongful past. At this point, it seems clear enough that the film wants to tell us “no one is innocent” and that the mysterious man symbolizes greed and guilt. However, it cleverly avoids pursuing this cliche and offers a surprising twist at the end. Of course, I’m not going to spoil it by telling you.Wu is certainly an adept actor in this film. And while I expected to see more of Yao Chen — it’s her first film after having a baby in July — it’s a pity that her part is not that prominent.But the real star of Control is Bi, who’s both the writer and director. Thanks to him, the film goes beyond the topic of “being controlled” to “losing control”, adding a refreshing angle to an existing concept.A man’s actions can be controlled, but not his heart. So if the controller plays with the wrong puppet, that can bring bad luck, too.
