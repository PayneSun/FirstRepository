Time to let go
Twelve years is a long time. There’s probably no one who agrees with this more than the crew of The Big Bang Theory, the CBS TV series that debuted in 2007 and is about to see its final season air on Sept 24.“This ride has been a dream come true and as life-changing as it gets,” wrote Kaley Cuoco, who plays Penny in the show, on US social networking platform Instagram. “No matter when it was going to end, my heart would have always been broken in two.”The “ride” started with four smart but socially awkward nerds – Leonard, Sheldon, Raj and Howard. All they ever talk about is science and video games, until an attractive woman, Penny, moves across the hall and completely changes their lives.CBS Entertainment chief Kelly Kahl called The Big Bang Theory “the defining comedy of its generation”, according to the Television Critics Association. It’s not only because the show has won 10 Emmys – actor Jim Parsons has won another four for his portrayal of Sheldon – but also that the show allows people to look at nerds in a brand new way: They may be socially awkward, but they can also be cool and kind once you get to know them.But no matter how exciting the ride is, it has to end at some point. This was also true of Friends (《老友记》，1994 – 2004), the classic TV series that ran for 10 years.And it’s not just the fans who feel like their life is about to end just because a show will. When filming the last scenes of Friends, US actress Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel on the show, told the Sydney Morning Herald, “This is gutting us. We’re like very delicate china, speeding towards a brick wall.”Yes, 12 years is a long time. But we feel nostalgic not just for the show itself, but also for the 12 years of our lives that we spent with it and that we can never go back to. But instead of being sad, we should remember the memories we made together.
