Kids ran around barefoot in the dirt
GUATEMALA offers an astonishing diversity of spectacular landscapes. In two weeks, we’d visited high mountains and colonial cities, a lush cloud forest and active volcanoes, deep lakes and limestone valleys.These views are packed into a relatively small country but change all the time, giving you the impression that you’re a member of a theater audience enraptured by a fantastical play.We left the highland Maya for their cousins in the lowlands, a vast area of thick tropical forests stretching down from Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula into the most northerly area of Guatemala.Our bus followed a lonely road, winding through wild lands where the scenery changed by the hour, from high mist-clad cloud forests into gently undulating hills before flattening out inside a landscape of swamp, savannah and, jungle.The change of climate was reflected in the local produce on display and growing all around us. Gone was the green palette of the coffee plant and avocado tree. It was usurped by tropical tones of yellow coconut palms and the banana plant.Even the locals have had to adapt, the local Maya women here eschewing the heavy, intricately embroidered blouses and shawls of the highlands for lighter blouses in shades of yellow, blue and pink.They worked under the blazing sun in little villages comprising modest dwellings, many with roofs thatched with palms, all with rough wooden planks for walls.Their kids ran around barefoot in the dirt, wrestling with each other in the road, apparently unconcerned about the odd vehicle which made its way in their direction.Then we left and fled to the village of El Remate. No aggressive touts here - only gentle locals who merrily greeted us as they rode slowly past on old bicycles.We holed up at an old guesthouse, its glory days long past, fantastical plasterwork cracking, furniture broken. Geckos clucked away from the walls of our room as rats fought in the ceiling above.We retreated to the old sun terrace and perched on a couple of cracked plastic chairs as the sun bid us a spectacular goodnight over the still waters.
