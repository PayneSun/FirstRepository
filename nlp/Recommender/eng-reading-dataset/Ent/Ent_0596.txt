Let’s talk about youthful dreams
Director Zhao Baogang has a lot to say about youth – his “youth” trilogy about the lives of the post-1980 generation testifies to the fact.In the 2007 TV series Struggle , the main characters fight to balance their successful careers with a romantic relationship. In My Youthfulness in 2009, a group of young people declare themselves their own masters and design their future.The final installment, Beijing Youth, which just finished recently, is about revisiting youth and young dreams once again.Explored from different angles, the mental and emotional pain of growing up is the main theme throughout the three drama series.In Beijing Youth, four cousins embark on a journey to rediscover their youth. They quit their jobs, leave their parents and Beijing, wander from place to place, earn a living from their passions, find love and realize their dreams.Zhao uses four characters to cover the entire post-1980 generation: He Dong, a civil servant on a stable salary; He Xi, a doctor, representing the growing bourgeois group; He Nan, an overseas returnee; and He Bei, who fools around without a job, but also wants to find his feet instead of depending on his rich dad.In Beijing Youth, the stories of these characters are collected along their traveling routes, told through their experiences in different cities, including Yantai, Shenzhen and Lijiang.During this drifting phase, they go through everything together. While their love stories are touching, what is more important is how they prove that their youth is exclusive and cannot be copied.As always in Zhao’s work, the cast of Beijing Youth is filled with gorgeous young actors and there are many amusing and memorable lines.Their road of rediscovery becomes a symphony of emotional collisions and conflicts. It’s where the fun and entertaining part of the series really shines through.“Youth is a very transient dream. When we wake up, it’s gone, along with all the memories of it,” Zhao said about the TV series in a press conference. “But throughout our lives, we always reflect on what youth has given us and what it has taught us.”“Everyone deserves a chance to regain their youth, especially young people. Because when you are young, you have nothing to lose.”
