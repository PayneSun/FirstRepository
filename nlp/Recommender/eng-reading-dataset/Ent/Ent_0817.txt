I’d like to thank my mother...
Accepting an award may seem like a simple task, but each year the Academy Awards proves there may be more to it than you might think.Oscar history has seen its fair share of memorable thank-you moments, good and bad.So the question remains: what makes a great acceptance speech? Here are three tips to keep in mind for your next glittering occasion:1.	Be grateful and humble. Make sure you thank the important people who helped you reach your goal. Don’t be too arrogant or boastful but don’t be so modest that the audience thinks you are trivializing the honor. It’s only natural to be a little emotional, so use this to inspire and personally relate to the audience. At this year’s Oscars, The King’s Speech director Tom Hooper told the story of how he only came to make the movie thanks to the help of his Australian mother, who was in the audience.He showed grace and humility when he mentioned her: “So, with this tonight, I honor you and the moral of the story is, listen to your mother.” 2. Keep it short. Say as much as you can in as few words as possible. There’s no need to thank every single person you know.As Oscar producer Bruce Cohen warned contenders at the annual nominees luncheon before this year’s show, “Nothing is more deadly than a winner reading a list of names.” Make each sentence meaningful and don’t get too carried away.3. Finally, maximize your moment. Don’t be afraid to have a little fun and say something memorable.Clever wit and humor will help your speech stand out in a good way and keep everyone entertained. Don’t make rude and inappropriate jokes, especially about others. Such jokes may get everyone talking, but you may be the only one laughing in the end. This time, Melissa Leo’s use of the F-word during her acceptance speech was the first in Oscar history. She said it before covering her mouth: “I really don’t mean to offend.”
