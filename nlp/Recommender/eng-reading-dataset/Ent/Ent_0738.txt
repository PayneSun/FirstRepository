Top tot celeb
She’s pipped Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga to the title. Yet she’s in diapers, can’t sleep through the night yet and is a long way off from eating solid foods.Harper Seven Beckham, at two months and two days old, has been named the hottest celebrity under the age of 25.InStyle’s Hot 100 list includes some of the most famous and impressive youngsters and adults, but the tiny new baby of Victoria and David Beckham - who is, presumably, far off her first career move - has been deemed the most powerful of them all.The British magazine said: ’Will she be a pop star, designer or sportswoman? Either way, Posh’s daughter inherits a gaggle of hunky older brothers and one heck of a wardrobe.’And she is not the only celebrity tot to have made the list. Following the Beckham’s only girl are Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani’s children, Zuma, three, and Kingston, five.Their rock and roll lineage suggests they may well be quite the musicians when older, though they are barely old enough to play instruments yet.Fourth on the list is high-heel lover, Suri Cruise, who at the tender age of five is nothing if not dedicated to the world of fashion.Could her wardrobe choices have deemed the tot worthy of inclusion? It’s more likely that her parents, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, provide the answer.Also in the top 100 were Lourdes Leon, in 15th place, Justin Bieber in 18th position and Saoirse Ronan at 19th.Harry Potter actress and face of Lancome and Burberry, Emma Watson, came in at number 44 and actress Amanda Seyfried capped the who’s who of success at a young age in 100th place.Though she debuted at Forbes’ most powerful celebrity earlier in the year, Lady Gaga has been placed only at number 99 on the Instyle tally.The headline-grabbing popstar, known for her eccentric, if not shocking, sartorial style, knocked Oprah Winfrey from the Forbes top spot. Oprah had held the title for four years.But the Instyle team seem to believe that Lady Gaga may be a passing trend. It’s tiny Harper Seven, with her whole life ahead of her, who is the apple of the glossy magazine’s eye.
