Soul Singer sparkles
When most people turn 21, they spend way too much time partying and having fun. But when Adele turned 21, she did something completely different.After going through a tough breakup, the British singer turned her pain into glory and recorded one of the most moving albums of the year.The album, 21, which was released in January, has already hit the charts in 14 countries, according to the Billboard magazine.It also noted that Adele made history as the first artist since the Beatles to have two top five singles and two top five albums in the charts at the same time (Adele’s debut album, 19, was released in 2008. Each album is named for her age when she wrote it).Now, after touring around the world for almost a year, the DVD of her live concert, released on November 29, is Adele’s latest work.Having topped the pre-order list of Amazon.com for over a month already, this one seems set to stay on top for a while.If you’ve heard her voice–and you likely have, considering that hit singles such as Rolling in the Deep and Someone Like You are played everywhere–it’s not hard to understand people’s obsession.“There are few young artists channeling the emotional heft and soul like 22-year-old Adele,” Adele’s manager Jonathan Dickins told the CNN. “She’s got that special glimmer.”Born in north London, Adele sang her way up honestly: In 2006, she was signed by England’s XL Recordings on the strength of a three-song demo a friend of hers had posted on MySpace; within two years she had won the BRIT Awards’ Critics’ Choice prize and been tipped by the BBC as the “Sound of 2008”.In 2009 she got the best new artist Grammy Award, and went on a world tour in support of the album 19 with a sold-out show in Los Angeles.According to Adele herself, much of the inspiration of her music comes from one single breakup.“I didn’t try to make all of my songs open-ended so they could apply to ‘anybody’,” Adele said in an interview with the Billboard magazine in February. “I wanted some to be as personal as possible.”Adele added that she may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea when writing songs, but she always knew what she wanted to say, and she definitely had “a master plan”.That’s probably what has fueled the singer’s success–that emotional certitude, according to Dickins.“The key to great singers is believing every single word they sing,” he said. “And I think you believe every word that comes out of Adele’s mouth. You can feel her life force through her voice.”
