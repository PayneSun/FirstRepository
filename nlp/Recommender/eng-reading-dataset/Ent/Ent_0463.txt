Blobfish wins ugliest animal vote
The grumpy-looking, gelatinous blobfish has won a public vote to become the official mascot of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society.This gives the fish the unofficial title of worldâ€™s ugliest animal. The winner was announced at the British Science Festival in Newcastle.The society began as a science-themed comedy night and devised its mascot campaign to draw attention to "aesthetically challenged" threatened species.The blobfish tops a list that includes the huge-nosed proboscis monkey, the similarly afflicted pig-nosed turtle, an amphibian affectionately known as a "scrotum frog" and pubic lice.Biologist and TV presenter Simon Watt, president of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, said he hoped the campaign would draw attention to the threats facing these weird and wonderful creatures.The blobfish eventually won by almost 10,000 votes.The bizarre creature lives off the coast of south-eastern Australia and Tasmania, at depths of between 600 and 1,200m, where atmospheric pressure is several dozen times higher than at sea level.
