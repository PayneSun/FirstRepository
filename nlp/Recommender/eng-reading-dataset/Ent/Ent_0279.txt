Flash zooms ahead of foes
It’s thought that when a hero like Batman is bestowed with great power, he or she must endure loneliness and suffering as a result. The Flash (Grant Gustin), however, makes a fun, lightning-quick and optimistic superhero.After the wild success of TV series Arrow in 2012 (a hit adaptation of the Green Arrow, comic books published by DC Comics), the US’ CW network launched TV series The Flash (2014), depicting this superhero, who was only a supporting character in Arrow.Like Spiderman’s Peter Parker, who gained the ability to sling webs and climb walls after being bitten by a spider, Barry Allen was shocked into superhero-status by accident. A strike from a lightning bolt put Allen into a nine-month coma, and when he emerged, he found himself endowed with super speed.Naturally, Allen slips on a colorful suit and becomes the Flash, a hero who uses his extreme speed to fight super-powered villains. But the Flash also has other motives, namely finding out the truth behind his mother’s death and his father’s unjust imprisonment.In keeping with superhero series norms, The Flash flaunts high-octane action and eye-popping special effects. There’s nothing terribly  innovative here, but what we do get is a unique superhero with a more offbeat personality.Although Allen has gone through childhood traumas like Batman’s Bruce Wayne, he’s not a lonely hero that every one admires but no one really knows. Instead, in this lighthearted show, he grows into a superhero whose powers include optimism.He’s got close friend and longtime crush Iris West (Candice Patton) on his team as well as STAR Labs, a group of scientists that not only save his life, but also provide him emotional support and the gadgetry necessary to fight crime.A big surprise for me was that The Flash cast Prison Break (2005-2009) star Wentworth Miller as supervillain Captain Cold, who wields a gun that can turn anything into ice. US shows began their entrance into the Chinese market with Friends (1994-2004), but Prison Break pushed interest in US TV series to a new climax largely thanks to Miller’s captivating acting.Now Miller’s back to act in The Flash. It’s a nice surprise that this new show serves as a platform for Prison Break fans to get reacquainted with an old favorite, even if this time around he’s an antagonist.With CW hinting at new villains and more high-tech weapons coming in the show’s second season, I think this series is only going to get more interesting as it picks up speed.
