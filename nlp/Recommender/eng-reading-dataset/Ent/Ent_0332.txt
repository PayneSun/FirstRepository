‘Blue Sky Bones’ shows rockers’ maturation
Cui Jian, China’s godfather of rock music, has two new titles: award-winning film director and screenwriter.His directorial debut, Blue Sky Bones, which garnered international recognition in Rome International Film Festival in late 2013, is beautifully accomplished, especially compared to his last attempt as a filmmaker — the 30-minute segment of the 2009 two-part movie Chengdu, I Love You— which was a chaotic jumble of ideas.The premise of Blue Sky Bones, briefly speaking, is a story about the “cultural revolution” (1966-76) told by a young computer hacker. It has two storylines: one about the hero Zhong Hua (Yin Fang), an underground songwriter who makes a living creating computer viruses and then selling anti-viruses to neutralize them; the other one about the love triangle of Zhong’s parents during the “lost 10 years” of the “cultural revolution”.Through flashbacks to the past and a jungle of thoughts expressed by the central character in philosophical voiceovers, the movie has a strong emotional thread and observes the lost generation of the “cultural revolution” through the eyes of a young man who’s trying to make sense of his life in an age of the Internet, music downloading and forgetfulness of the past.Cui has described his role on the film as “orchestrating the actors, the music and the script” and leaving the rest of the production work to professionals in each field. Cui’s use of music binds together the whole structure of the film, giving it a genuine dramatic power that compliments the emotive voiceovers by the main character.Cui’s wisest choice, however, was hiring Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who is known for his work on Wong Kar-wai films. Doyle’s photography brings atmosphere and shape to the story as it jumps between past and present.The most noticeable weakness about the film is the script. Cui’s got so much ambition in storytelling that the two subplots don’t sit comfortably within the movie.But the movie does all come together in its final sequence, which creatively cross-cuts between scenes of a timeless China on the Yangtze River with Zhong performing the title song. Cui’s embracing of traditional values of love and forgiveness, in such a genuine way, is quite surprising. It reminds us of a fact that no one wants to accept: the bad-boy rocker, now 52, has finally hit middle age.
