Nutty squirrel photos are a hit
Retired postwoman Kathy Pruyn in Florida sets up the hilarious scenes by strategically placing peanuts and peanut butter among the toys.Mrs Pruyn said: “I fed the squirrels after they had fallen out of a nest and when I released them they still came back to my garden for food. One day I was going through the old toys that needed throwing out and I just thought it would be funny to see the squirrels with them.”She came up with the idea to photograph them while rummaging through the toys left at her home by her three grandchildren when they grew up.“Sometimes they eat too fast and I can’t get the picture, other times they run off with the toy and leave it in the tree.”He must be playing the Nutcracker: Squirrel captured at children’s piano... with the help of some peanut butter.This squirrel looks like he’s enjoying a spot of karaoke.This fearless critter hops on to a tiny skateboard in search of peanut treats.This squirrel looks like he’s towing a trailer full of cuddly toys.The animal appears to have mastered the long pot in this image of a pool table.
