Breaking Dawn: vampires are back
Twilight follows in the footsteps of Harry Potter, the most successful print-to-screen franchise that recently concluded an epic journey lasting a decade. The finale of the screen adaptation of the series by Stephanie Meyer’s has begun–starting with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 1.Undoubtedly, the most anticipated part of the film is that Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally get to seal their love for each other by getting married.The wedding takes the first half hour of the film. Seeing Edward watch Bella walk down that aisle, adoration in his eyes, the relief when she says “yes”, the kiss that seals their union–it doesn’t seem like acting (if it is, then it’s one of Pattinson’s best performances).Then the human-vampire couple head off to sunny Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon.Before you know it, Bella is pregnant–and that is just the beginning of their problems.But that’s not the film’s real problem. What Meyer did so brilliantly in the book, and what the script fails to do, is to communicate all the drama of the symbolic implications of immortality.The book gives quite a few of its 756 pages to Bella’s struggle with dying instead of living forever, especially how her parents feel and Edward’s guilt.And there is barely a mention of the provocative abortion debate: should the vampire-human hybrid be “removed” before it kills Bella?For conflict, we’re left with Bella in a few moments of contemplation and consternation–which requires very little from Stewart, an actress capable of so much more.The rest of the tension building is left up to Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and his werewolf issues. He goes postal when the wedding invitation arrives, hackles raised, and lots of growling, disappearing for days, so that’s a real nail-biter…For those keeping score, Breaking Dawn is missing the interesting indie edge of the first film. It does not flatline as badly as the second, New Moon. It loses the brief emotional uptick of No 3, Eclipse. So in the “Twilight” pantheon, Breaking Dawn Part 1 is at best a draw.However, the Twilight films always manage to cleverly blend melodrama with supernatural thrills. While the film is not without its silly moments and awkward dialogue, it does deliver the drama and emotional highs we have come to expect.Roll on the concluding film in November next year.
