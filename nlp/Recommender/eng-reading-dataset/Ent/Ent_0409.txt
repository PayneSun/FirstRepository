‘World’s worst’ waxworks
Looks like whoever bought this bunch of dummies could be suffering from an identity crisis…The world’s worst waxworks collection has been snapped up by a mystery buyer from the Czech Republic, just over a year after it closed amid a storm of ridicule.Jane and Peter Hayes’ 150 models, which cost up to £1,000 new, gained cult status because they look so little like the people they supposedly represent.Many tourists only paid the £5 entry fee to see the waxworks, which include celebrities, sports stars and members of the Royal Family.Jane, 83, who still lives above the former attraction in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, with 86-year-old Peter, said: “All the models and machines and frames were sold in one go.“I don’t really know who the chap was but he took everything."“We have to leave the building now too because we can’t afford to pay the £7,500-a-year business rates."“We hadn’t planned to leave and we miss the business terribly. But me and my husband have both been ill and thought it was foolish to keep going.""We had a lot of bad press and I feel a bit irritated that the local people didn’t stick up for us a bit more.”"The closure wasn’t because of the reaction to our models though. We just thought we were too old to keep it going. " The 19th century building which houses the Louis Tussauds House of Wax is on sale for £375,000.Peter, who ran the museum for 57 years, admitted in 2008 that the models became so old they were no longer lifelike.Visitors struggled to recognise the likes of Prince Charles, the Queen, Cliff Richard, Sean Connery and The Beatles.The museum closed in October 2012.
