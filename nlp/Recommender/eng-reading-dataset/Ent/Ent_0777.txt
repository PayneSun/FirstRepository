Seven coolest shower designs
1 Aquarium ShowerThis totally baller shower enclosure called Plano Acquario by Cesena has a real aquarium built right into one of the walls. How cool would it be to be standing in the shower under a flow of water while watching fish swim around you?2 Deer Stag ShowerHave you ever wondered what it would be like to take a shower with a deer stag head spewing water onto you? This porcelain version was unveiled at Milan Design Week 2010.3 Colour Phasing Shower LightThis is shower head with a temperature controlled light so you will never burn your bottom again. Temperature changes from green (when the temperature is less than 32C) to red (at more than 45C). The phasing colours in between are blue, orange, purple and pink.4 The 18-head ShowerAs you can see in the picture, this shower does enjoy the advantage of sporting 18 different shower heads. Well, one only needs to look at its price tag. $100,000. Yes, that is 5 zeros you are looking at.5 Folding ShowerThis Folding Shower is currently looking for a manufacturer and a distributor. It has a unique design that’s supposed to allow people living in small apartments to install a shower that doesn’t take up too much of their limited space.6 Rotating ShowerThe industrial designer Ron Arad came up with this rotating shower/bath with Italian manufacturers Teuco. You can have a bath in the lip, or rotate it around to give you a shower cabinet if you fancy that instead. Of course, you’ll need a bathroom the size of most of our entire flats to fit it in.7 Pocket ShowerThis is a very cool idea for campers, the pocket shower, fill with water, hang from tree, get clean. The pocket shower comes in a fist sized bag but can hold up to 10 liters of water which is enough for a 7 minute shower. You can buy the pocket shower for $26.98.
