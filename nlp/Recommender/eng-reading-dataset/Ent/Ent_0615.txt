Holy mackerel, Batman’s back
It’s been a summer of great expectations. Hollywood blockbusters such as The Avengers and Prometheus have attracted millions of filmgoers and made a load of money.Now here comes another big one–The Dark Knight Rises.Can US director Christopher Nolan *see out his Batman *trilogy in style? Can he make the superhero movie, which gets the *blend between action, emotion, plot and character just right? Can he live up to the eye-popping standard he set with 2008’s The Dark Knight?The answers are yes, no, and mostly. As its running time suggests, The Dark Knight Rises is a *sprawling, epic *feast of a movie, with side characters, subplots and *diversions.We’re reintroduced to Bruce Wayne, also known as Batman (Christian Bale). He lives as a *recluse, holed up in the east wing of Wayne Manor while Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) *presides over a relatively crime-free Gotham City.But when *marauding, mask-wearing psycho Bane (Tom Hardy) muscles in with the intention of starting a popular revolution, Bruce must put on the *cape and *cowl once again.This is just the central thread in an increasingly *tangled story: there’s also Anne Hathaway as a *slinky Catwoman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a square-jawed cop and lots of confusing financial *shenanigans with the shareholders of Wayne Enterprises. As in the previous films, Nolan and his co-writer, his brother Jonathan, draw on real-world issues to spice up the fantasy: with its *raging Occupy Gotham *anarchists, good-hearted billionaires and decent cops who ignore due process, this is *staunchly right-wing.But when the Bat flies, such considerations go out the window. *Sublimating CGI (computer-generated image) in favor of real crowd scenes and massive cityscapes, Nolan creates a grand, dirty, *engrossing world, and his action sequences *hum. The way the various story lines tie up is a bit predictable, but it’s satisfying nonetheless.And as our heroes *swoop off into the sunset, we realize we’ve been witness to something truly impressive: a seven-year cinematic adventure which combined the epic and the personal in *dizzying, inventive, sometimes confusing, often fascinating, always imaginative ways.
