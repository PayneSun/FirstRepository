Emma's leg is airbrushed
Photoshop focus on Demi Moore’s December cover for W Magazine will finally die down, thanks to new ads that leave Emma Watson without a leg to stand on.Demi Moore, the Ghost star, appears on the December cover of W magazine with her hip looking abnormally small, just a few inches smaller than her thigh. Online gossip has it that it’s an airbrushed hip. Moore firmly denied the rumor, even scolding gossipers in her Twitter. But the noted photographer Anthony Citrano is adamant in saying that Moore has not been completely honest with fans. He’s offered a $5,000(34,145yuan) wager for her to prove the picture is “original”.This Emma’s photo, from the Burberry SS2010 shoot by famed photographer Mario Testino, shows the "Harry Potter" starlet posing with her brother Alex in Burberry’s new clothes...but missing a body part we’re pretty sure she still has!In the photo, Watson’s right leg appears to take a mysterious turn before disappearing altogether, perhaps the result of a post-photo shoot editing session gone terribly awry. There’s the possibility that Watson’s leg is fully obscured by her brother’s, but that would likely mean she’s standing on a box or posing with one leg up (which might explain why she’s got her arm wrapped around him for support). Without seeing the entire/original shot, we’ll never know, but at least the missing limb reappears in this additional photo for the campaign.Nobody involved in the photo shoot has yet to comment. But unlike the Demi Moore incident, in which all parties vigorously denied any touch-ups, Emma’s missing limb seems like it will be considerably harder to explain away.Maybe this time, everyone can just laugh it off -- after all, even skilled photo re-touchers make mistakes now and then. We’re just glad Emma’s okay.
