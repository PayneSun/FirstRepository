Our super humans
The greatest American superhero team ever is back on the big screen. Highly anticipated Avengers sequel “Age of Ultron” finally arrived at cinemas on the Chinese mainland on May 12.This time the all-star ensemble including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and others is tasked with a greater test of will – defeating the villainous Ultron, who is accidentally created when Iron Man jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program and the experiment goes wrong.Superhero movies always manage to provide thrilling action scenes, and this sequel’s perfectly executed sequences don’t disappoint. To live up to the high standards established by its predecessor, “Age of Ultron” set Marvel’s record for visual effects, packing in over 3,000 special effects shots, according to Screenrant.com.Everyone knows the Avengers are dedicated to safeguarding Earth from evils too powerful for a single hero to combat. But this time US writer and director Joss Whedon tries to deliver a more interesting and exciting storyline that allows every character to shine as a hero and as a human being.“I got to say a lot of things about humanity, personal relationships and society... Superheroes are the best version of us, and at the same time, they are the goofiest and worst version we could be,” Whedon said in a conversation with Mtime.Everyone on the team adds to the movie, with the chemistry between Black Widow and Hulk getting a lot of praise from reviewers.“Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon,” Christian Science Monitor film critic Peter Rainer said, criticizing the robot series as mindlessly destructive .While “Age of Ultron” has met fan expectations, there’s a bit of a steep learning curve for those unfamiliar with the Marvel superheroes or who never watched the last Avengers film. The movie opens with a straightforward fight, never bothering to introduce the characters, and the many surprises and twists that follow could be difficult for the newly initiated to keep up with.“It’s just an action blockbuster for an ordinary audience, but surprises are everywhere for Marvel fans, so you’d better do some preparation before going to the cinema,” suggests Mtime.
