John Lennon's 'Gruesome'Tooth Sells for Nearly $32,000 at Auction
Of all the weirdaspects of the John Lennon tooth auction, we suppose that a dentistbeing the winner makes the most sense.As the BBC reports, Canadian dentist Michael Zuk won the late Beatle’s discarded, discoloredmolar with a winning bet of $31,200 U.S. at the Nov. 5 auction. The tooth was originally expected to fetch about $16,000."Once I heard it was up for sale I had to have it," Zuk told the BBC. "Some people will think its gross, others will be fascinated by it." (Consider us in the former category.)Zuk revealed he’ll put Lennon’s tooth on display in his office and show it off at events at dental schools and other offices.Lennon originally had the tooth pulled in the late ’60s and then gave it to his housekeeper, who saved it as a rare piece of memorabiliafor her daughter. Somehow, the molarended up in the possessionof Alan McGee, the music executive who managed Oasis and the Libertines, among others.As you can see above, the tooth is not a pristineartifactby any means. "It’s rather gruesome, yellowy, browny with a cavity.If you need us, we’ll be brushing our teeth and trying not to gagover that horrible picture.
