eBay seller: Nicolas Cage is a vampire
Nic Cage has taken on a lot of wacky roles in his career, but even this is strange.The Oscar-winning actor is a centuries-old real-life vampire -- according to an antique photo collector who’s selling a Civil-War era photo of a man who is near-identical to Cage."Personally, I believe it’s him and that he is some sort of walking undead/vampire, et cetera, who quickens/reinvents himself once every 75 years or so," the seller -- who’s asking $1 million for the photo -- writes on eBay. "150 years from now, he might be a politician, the leader of a cult, or a talk show host."The seller, who goes by the name Jack Mord and has 100% positive feedback, insists the photo is the real deal and has not been manipulated in any way to make it resemble Cage."Any serious potential buyer will be allowed to have a photo expert of their choice examine the original photograph before any money changes hands," he adds on eBay.But although the seller seems somewhat serious about his find, the commenters on his eBay page are finding the obvious humor in the ridiculous story."dude ... YOU smoke way too much weed!" writes one, to which the seller responded that he was "insulted" because he prefers "Mexican black tar heroin."Another claims to actually be Nic Cage and asks what discount he would get if he buys back the photo. (He’d get 25 percent off.)Another potential purchaser notes, "Nick Cage has aged terribly in the past 10 years, he’s obviously not been drinking his daily amount of blood to stay young."The seller’s thought-out response: "My theory is that he allows himself to age to a certain point, maybe 70, 80 or so, then the actor ’Nicolas Cage’ will ’die’... but in reality, the undead vampire ’Nicolas Cage’ will have rejuvenated himself and appeared in some other part of the world, young again, and ready to start all over."From time to time somebody might mention to him that he bears a slight resemblance to the young version that dead American actor, whose name they can’t recall, but eventually, those occurrences will stop altogether."The photographer who snapped the creepy pic, Professor G.B. Smith, was famous for his portraits of confederate Civil War prisoners of war.Cage has yet to confirm or deny his undead status.
