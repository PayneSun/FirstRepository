World stage for tomorrow’s talent
The city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province is a frequent headline grabber. As a major tourist attraction in China, there were so many tourists during last year’s peak travel seasons that most of them took in the top of each other’s heads rather than one of the many sights. But that didn’t stop 120 million Chinese and about 3.4 million foreigners from visiting the city in 2015. Hangzhou is also a *hub of creativity and *entrepreneurship, being home to internet giants such as the Alibaba Group and NetEase.That being said, the city has never drawn so much attention as it did the past week. The host of the G20 Leaders Summit welcomed heads of the world’s 20 major economies and international organizations. For two days, they discussed topics including strengthened policy coordination, building new paths for growth, effective economic and financial governance, as well as strong world trade and investment.On the night of Sept 4, the city also entertained its guests and audience from around the world with a gala directed by Zhang Yimou.The show, entitled Symphony on West Lake (《最忆是杭州》), is based on Zhang Yimou’s Impressions of West Lake (《印象西湖》), an astonishing performance that takes place right on the surface of the water, combining music, dance, and light effects all against the *backdrop of nature.Influential discussions and *spectacular shows may be enough to draw the world’s gaze toward Hangzhou, but for young people around the world, the G20 summit has more to offer. It is an global event that they can participate in as volunteers, to nurture their communication skills; it is a *multilateral dialogue, whose results are going to affect theirs and their fellow young people’s career prospects; it motivates and inspires youths of different cultures to exchange ideas; it even helps young Chinese people to learn more about their own culture. And these reasons are what are drawing the notice of young people toward the G20 summit.
