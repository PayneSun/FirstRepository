McDonald's CEO 'Under Siege' At Home And Abroad
McDonald’s Corp CEO Don Thompson, the head of the world’s biggest restaurant chain, who for much of his two years at the helm has been battling to spark sales growth in the United States and Europe, got battered by headline-grabbing bad news in late July.In the final days of the month, its China business was hit with a food-safety scare involving a key supplier; the chain got ensnared in the West’s sanctions standoff with Russia; burger flippers at U.S. restaurants claimed an incremental win from the National Labor Relations Board in their fight to hold McDonald’s responsible for the actions of franchisees; and, a Texas jury slapped the company with a $27 million verdict. Add to all that its results showed second-quarter profit dropped more than expected.McDonald’s was caught up in the latest China food safety scare after a July 20 television expose showed workers allegedly mishandling meat at Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a factory owned by OSI Group LLC, a major supplier to the chain.When the story broke, McDonald’s China business had been rebounding from the double whammy of a food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak that crushed sales in 2013.McDonald’s roughly 2,000 restaurants in China suffered meat shortages after it ended its relationship with OSI China."They’re under siege on three continents," said Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research firm.To be sure, the company’s famous name and the ubiquity of its restaurants worldwide help to fuel the media storm, said Penney: "McDonald’s is a pawn in many instances around the world. It’s an easy target."Such upheavals are not uncommon for McDonald’s and other global power houses, including Coca-Cola Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, experts said, though perhaps not quite so many in such a short period.Investors, analysts and franchisees are clamoring for the company to stop trying to be "all things to all people". They want it to simplify its unwieldy menu and point to the success of rivals, which have won passionate fans by selling just a few items.
