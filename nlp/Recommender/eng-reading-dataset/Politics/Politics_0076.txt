Bullied teen massacres shoppers
An 18-year-old German-Iranian gunman opened fire in a busy shopping mall in Munich on July 22, before killing himself with the same pistol. The mass shooting left 10 people dead, including the gunman, and 27 hurt.Though rumors swirled about the attacker’s motives, German police revealed on July 23 that the gunman–identified by authorities as David S. and whose family name was Sonboly, according to German news reports–had no connection with Islamist extremism. Instead, he was “obsessed with shooting *rampages”.The Munich police chief, Hubertus Andrae, told the Los Angeles Times that investigators who searched Sonboly’s home found literature about mass shootings, including an academic study of students who kill. He was also an *avid player of violent video games, including Counter Strike: Source, which Robert Heimberger, head of Bavaria’s criminal police, identified as “a game played by nearly every known rampage killer”.A video posted online after the mass shooting offers a glimpse into Sonboly’s mindset. The video shows a gunman, believed to be Sonboly, arguing with another man standing on a balcony during the shootings. He shouted: “Because of you I was bullied for seven years ... and now I have to buy a gun to shoot you.”A post on a chatroom website seemed to confirm that Sonboly was a victim of bullying. One of his former classmates said: “He was in my class. We always mobbed him in school, and he always told us that he would kill us.”*Perpetrators of mass killings often share a history of *dysfunctional relationships, according to Peter Aylward, a *forensic *psychoanalyst at Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital in the UK.“It is a psychiatric problem,” he told BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, “and such planning [as the Nice or Munich attacks] indicates a disordered personality. With such *premeditation there is a desire to enact a form of revenge, and with such intent on causing major terror.”
