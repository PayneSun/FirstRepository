Terrorists target capital
Belgium became the latest site of a major terrorist attack in Europe on March 22, when suicide bombers killed 31 people and injured at least 270 at a metro station and airport in its capital, Brussels.An investigation has revealed that the bombings were linked to last November’s Paris attacks, which left 130 people dead.The terrorist group IS claimed responsibility for the attacks in both Paris and Brussels.The Belgium bombings came just two days after Salah Abdeslam, a suspect in the Paris attacks, was captured by police in an apartment building in Brussels. It is yet not clear if the bombings were an act of revenge or if they were planned without connection to Abdeslam’s arrest.Terror experts say Belgium is extremely vulnerable to terrorist attacks organized by radical Islamists. According to the BBC, some 500 of its citizens have been lured into fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq. More Belgian Islamists have gone to fight for IS than from any other European country per capita. Almost half have come from Brussels.Show of powerThe latest attacks demonstrate how vast IS’ network has grown, both in Belgium and possibly across Europe, according to The Economist. “To be able to conduct serial complex attacks suggests IS can draw on perhaps hundreds of supporters, some of whom have reliable bomb-making expertise and know how to communicate securely,” it said. In its follow-up coverage, The Economist also warned that big cities in Europe and the US “will have to get used to a long campaign of terror in which all are targets”.Following the Brussels attacks, the US State Department has warned Americans traveling in Europe to “exercise vigilance when in public places or using mass transportation”. Terrorist groups, the department travel alert said, “continue to plan near-term attacks throughout Europe, targeting sporting events, tourist sites, restaurants and transportation.”
