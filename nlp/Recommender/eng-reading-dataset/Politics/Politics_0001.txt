Attack on bus driver brings safety review
It was a shock and a painful lesson for many people when the police announced the cause of a bus accident in Chongqing on Oct 28.Video footage from inside the bus suggested that after a passenger missed her stop and asked the driver to stop, he refused, and she began hitting him over the head with her cell phone.During the conflict, the driver lost control of the bus and it plunged into the Yangtze River. The accident left 13 people dead and two missing, according to Xinhua.Zheng Chuankai, a lawyer with Anli Partners in Beijing, said the accident showed that it is important that those who cause danger to public safety face stiff penalties.Such attacks are vicious but common, Zheng told The New York Times.In fact, it is not rare to hear of passengers attacking bus drivers in China. This month, a local court in Shenyang, Liaoning province, sentenced three people to up to three years in prison for endangering public safety by distracting bus drivers, Xinhua reported.“Passengers who interfere with bus drivers are endangering public safety, which is tantamount to serious crimes like arson and poisoning,” Liu Changsong, a Beijing lawyer, told the Global Times.To prevent similar cases from happening, many Chinese cities have taken measures to keep bus drivers safe.Beijing, with over 70 percent of buses having separate driver’s cabins, has promised to replace old buses that do not have safety partitions with new ones having such devices.Dozens of cities including Xi’an, Wuhan, Changsha and Nanning have plans to add safety partitions to buses to protect drivers from any interference by passengers.The bus operator in Quanzhou, Fujian province, has invited psychologists to teach drivers how to manage their emotions when encountering an angry passenger.“These measures are necessary, but they are not enough,” said Xinhua.“Public security is closely connected with social morality. People should obey the law, be self-disciplined and calmer and be more rational.”Many countries have introduced measures to deal with the problem of violence against bus drivers.According to CGTN, on every bus in the US state of New Jersey, a sign on the back of the driver’s seat warns passengers that anyone attacking a driver can be fined or put into prison.In London, the local government has launched a program to train drivers to deal with angry passengers and avoid potential conflicts, BBC News reported.
