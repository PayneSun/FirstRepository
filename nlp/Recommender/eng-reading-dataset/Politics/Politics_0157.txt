2011: a tumultuous year
1 Japanese Earth-quake and TsunamiAn earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale struck the north-east coast of Japan on March 11 and triggered a massive tsunami that led to the death of almost 16,000 people.In addition to this enormous loss of life and the destruction of infrastructure, the tsunami also caused a number of nuclear accidents.This included a level 7 meltdown at three reactors in the Fukushima No 1 Nuclear Power Plant complex and saw the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of neighboring residents. According Naoto Kan, the Japanese prime minister at the time, “In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan.”In the immediate aftermath, around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water.2 European debt crisisThis year saw anxiety over rising government debt in Europe escalate into a crisis of global proportions.From late 2010 onwards, concerns over Europe’s economic stability had begun to intensify. Greece, Ireland and Portugal had difficulties refinancing their debts. This sent ripples around the world and all major stock exchanges exhibited significant losses.Many western countries are seeking China’s pledge to help stimulate the continent’s economy and lift market confidence.Some contend that Europe’s financial turmoil can threaten the demand for Chinese exports to the region. However, Chinese economic experts insist China should not blindly buy the euro debt.3 The Arab unrest2011 saw a wave of demonstrations and protests sweep across the Arab world.There have been drastic upheavals in Tunisia and Egypt, a civil war in Libya and protests in Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco and Oman.The upheavals have seen the departure of political strongmen such as Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak and Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh.Muammar Gadhafi, the former leader of Libya, was killed. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is still struggling to remain in power amid domestic discontent and foreign pressure.These grassroots movements have differed from previous protests in that religion has not been a driving force.4 Death of Kim Jong-ilKim Jong-il, leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) passed away on December 17.According to a report by the DPRK’s official KCNA news agency, the 69-year-old died of a heart attack on a train due to “great mental and physical strain” during a “high intensity field inspection”.China on December 19 sent its condolences on the death of Kim, noting that the late DPRK leader had carried on and further developed the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK.Observers maintain that the death will not result in turbulence in the DPRK. The KCNA news agency said the country, people and military “should remain loyal to the guidance of respected Kim Jong-un”.5 Death of Osama bin Laden and the end of the Iraq WarOn December 18, the US military officially ended its war in Iraq nearly nine years after the invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein. In a conflict that has seen almost 4,500 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis lose their lives, this year has thus seen the end of the most unpopular US military venture since Vietnam.Prior to the withdrawal of troops, US anti-terrorist efforts had already sustained a victory following the death of Osama bin Laden.In May, bin Laden, was killed by a US special forces. Believed to have ordered the attacks on the US on September 11 2001, bin Laden’s death came as a defining moment in the American-led “war against terrorism”.
