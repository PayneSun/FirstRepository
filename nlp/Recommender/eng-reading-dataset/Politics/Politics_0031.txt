Country’s future plans put forward
Oct 18 was a big day. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) opened in Beijing on that day. The congress is important to both the Party and China, as it’s where more than 2,300 Party delegates and specially invited delegates from all walks of life will make decisions about China’s future.On behalf of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC, General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a report to the opening of the congress.In this year’s report, Xi said socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. Xi also unveiled“Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, which experts said is the most important improvement on the original theory raised over three decades ago.In the report, Xi outlined a two-step approach to build China into a great modern socialist country by the middle of the century after the completion of building a moderately prosperous society by 2020.One of the key messages from Xi’s report, a verdict on the principal contradiction  facing Chinese society, has the word in it.“What we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life,” Xi said in his speech.It is the first time that the definition of the principal contradiction set 36 years ago has been changed.The Chinese phrase “mei hao sheng huo”, which can be translated as “a better life” or “a happy life”, appeared in the report 14 times, including in both the opening section and the last paragraph.It’s not the first time that Xi has used this phrase.“To meet the people’s desire for a happy life is our mission,” Xi said when meeting the press after being elected General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee in late 2012.And the past five years have seen our top leaders make efforts to improve people’s livelihoods. This is shown in the fact that in spite of China’s slower growth in recent years, the countries leaders have made job creation a key task. They did this by keeping the urban job-less rate below 4 percent. This has by no means been an easy task for the world’s most populous country, particularly at a time when the country has been going all out to promote economic and structural adjustments.The people-first approach can also be seen in the achievements that have been made in poverty alleviation. The impoverished population in rural areas has been reduced by 13 million a year from 2013 to 2016. The top leadership aims to pull all residents out of poverty by 2020.Just as Xi said in the report on Oct 18, “We must regard as our goal the people’s aspirations to live a better life.”
