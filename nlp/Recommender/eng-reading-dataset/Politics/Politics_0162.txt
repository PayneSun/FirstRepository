Photographs of Rice found in Gaddafi lair
A bizarre photograph album filled page to page with pictures of Condoleezza Rice has been found at the compound of Colonel Gaddafi.As citizens ransacked the sprawling lair, a number of unusual items have been looted.Perhaps the most surprising, however, was the album, filled with glossy pictures of America’s former Secretary of State.Colonel Gaddafi had previously hinted at a serious admiration for Rice.In an interview with Al-Jazeera television in 2007, he hinted that then-President George W. Bush’s top diplomat wielded considerable influence in the Arab world.’I support my darling black African woman,’ he said at the time. ’I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders. ... Leezza, Leezza, Leezza. ... I love her very much. I admire her, and I’m proud of her, because she’s a black woman of African origin.’The following year, Gaddafi and Rice had an opportunity to meet when the secretary of state paid a historic visit to Libya - one that made steps toward normalising relations after the United States went decades without an ambassador in Tripoli.She said during the trip that the U.S. ’doesn’t have any permanent enemies.’Gaddafi welcomed Rice in his home - one that President Ronald Reagan once ordered bombed in retaliation for Libya’s attack on a German disco - for the traditional meal that ends the daylight fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Once again, he repeatedly addressed Rice - known as ’Condi’ to her friends - as ’Leezza’.During the visit, he presented Rice with a diamond ring, a lute, a locket with an engraved likeness of himself inside and an inscribed edition of The Green Book’.Together, thehaul was worth $212,000.
