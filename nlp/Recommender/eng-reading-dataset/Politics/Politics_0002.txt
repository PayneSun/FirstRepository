China-Japan ties at ‘historic’ point
Confucius, the ancient philosopher of China, said that at the age of 40, one shall have no more doubts.Forty years ago, China and Japan, whose cultures are influenced by Confucian thought, concluded their Treaty of Peace and Friendship. The treaty came into effect on Oct 23, 1978. Since then, the treaty has helped to keep the ship of their relations afloat in sometimes stormy waters.From Oct 25 to 27, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited China. This was the first official visit by a Japanese prime minister since 2011.During Abe’s visit, both China and Japan expressed their shared confidence that the two countries are still on the right course and will continue to stick to the guiding principles of the treaty.This visit was fruitful. For example, companies from China and Japan signed over 50 deals for cooperation in areas like infrastructure and services.At the meeting with Abe at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, President Xi Jinping commented on the visit.With joint efforts made by the two sides, China-Japan relations are returning to the normal track with positive momentum, which should be cherished by the two countries, said Xi.Xi also said, “We should seize this historic opportunity and make it become a new historic orientation for the development of Sino-Japanese relations.”Abe said he expected that, through this visit, the two countries could start a new era that replaces competition with coordination in bilateral ties.Both the Chinese and Japanese sides regard their bilateral relations as important. A survey released by China International Publishing Group and Genron NPO, a Japanese think tank, in October, asked people from the nations for their views: 74 percent of the Chinese respondents said they believe that bilateral relations are “important” or “very important” while 71.4 percent of Japanese respondents agreed with them.“In fact, it’s a common understanding among Japanese politicians as well as the Japanese people that enhancing relationship with China is very important,” Akio Takahara, a professor at the University of Tokyo, told reporters at the Foreign Press Center of Japan.The two countries are expected to work together for the good of the region.“For as two major economies and two important players in regional and international platforms, Beijing and Tokyo can play a significant role in building peace and stability in Northeast Asia and drive forward economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific,” commented China Daily.
