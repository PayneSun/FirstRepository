Hangzhou’s time to shine
As the G20 Leaders Summit kicks off on Sept 4, Hangzhou, the host city, is ramping up measures to promote its reputation for entrepreneurship, as well as its many beauty spots, to those overseas.One of the strongest *endorsements comes from Jack Ma, founder of the Hangzhou-based global internet giant Alibaba.In a TV interview on Aug 25, Ma explained why he chose to stand with Hangzhou from the very beginning.“Because this city has entrepreneurship. It’s so friendly to private sectors, and people here are well-educated,” Ma said. “We’ve got great talent, we’ve got a good environment, and we’ve got great culture, fighting for the future.”Although many may have been surprised when Hangzhou was chosen to host the summit over bigger cities such as Beijing or Shanghai, economic statistics suggest that it’s well deserving of the honor.When the national economy grew at 6.7 percent in the first half of this year, the lowest in more than two decades, Hangzhou steamed ahead with a massive 10.8 percent growth, becoming one of the only two cities in China, alongside Chongqing, with a double-digit growth rate.Walking along the streets of Hangzhou, through centuries-old *alleys and along the Broadway-like Yan’an Avenue, a tourist can pick up whatever he or she wants with just a smartphone, via Alipay or WeChat Pay - no cash or credit cards needed.And starting this month, one can also rent public bikes simply by scanning the QR code with a smartphone.Meanwhile, a short video showcasing the beauty of Zhejiang province and its capital, Hangzhou, is being aired on CNBC channels during prime time through Sept 12.The promotional video, created by CNBC’s Catalyst Content Studio, highlights some of Hangzhou’s most alluring attractions.From eye-pleasing beauty spots like the Qiantang River and West Lake to the towering headquarters of leading internet corporations, the promo shows how the city built its legacy on a long history of commerce and seafaring and developed into a vast modern hub of technology, imports and exports.
