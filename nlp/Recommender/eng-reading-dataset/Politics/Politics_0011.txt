Canceled Iran deal causes discussion
An announcement made by US President Donald Trump on May 8 has sent shockwaves around the world.Trump said that he will withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal.The deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was signed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (the US, Russia, China, the UK and France), as well as Germany and Iran, in 2015.Before the deal, the countries introduced a set of sanctions on Iran as punishment for its nuclear development. But under the deal, Iran would stop its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the lifting of certain sanctions.However, Trump had long believed the deal was a bad idea. During the 2016 US presidential election, he promised to withdraw the deal after he took office.Trump believed the deal failed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. “It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” Trump said on May 8. He added that the US would carry out “the highest level” of economic sanctions on Iran.The decision immediately drew global concern. Darrell West, senior fellow from the Brookings Institution, a US policy research center, told Xinhua News Agency that “the risk is [that] his decision will cause an arms race in the Middle East”.“Iran may restart its nuclear program and that could [cause] Saudi Arabia to develop its own nuclear program. The region is likely to become more volatile and chaotic as a result of the deal nullification,” he said.However, the US’ pullout from the deal doesn’t mean it’s dead. In a joint statement released by French President Emmanuel Macron’s office on May 8, French, German and UK leaders regretted the US decision.Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May restated their “continued commitment” to the Iran nuclear deal, stressing that it “is of particular importance to our shared security”.Russia also remains open to further interaction with other participants of the Iran nuclear deal, according to a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry on May 8.China “regrets” the US’ decision, and Beijing will continue its commitment to safeguard and implement the deal, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on May 9.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country will remain in the deal. “If the deal remains live, we can take steps for the world’s peace and security,” Rouhani said on May 8.
