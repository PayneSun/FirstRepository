Taiwan leader avoids key issue
On May 20, Tsai Ing-wen took office as Taiwan’s new leader, delivering a much-scrutinized inauguration speech. In an editorial about the speech, China Daily condemned Tsai for using “rhetorical ambiguity” to avoid talking about the one-China principle, and thereby bringing uncertainty to cross-Straits ties.In her speech, Tsai was careful neither to cross the mainland’s red line, nor endorse the 1992 Consensus on one China.As she had done on multiple previous occasions, she pledged her administration will strive to preserve peace and stability in cross-Straits ties, as well as the existing mechanisms of dialogue and communication.“She wants all the benefits cross-Straits rapport has brought to Taiwan, but without acknowledging what made that possible,” the editorial explained.Both the mainland and the previous administration in Taiwan, led by Ma Ying-jeou, agreed on the 1992 Consensus. This concept is credited for having “established the political bedrock for the good momentum in cross-Straits ties over the last eight years by highlighting the one China principle”.Yet Tsai has distanced herself from her predecessor’s position toward the one-China policy. She said she respects the historical fact that the two sides talked and reached a number of agreements in 1992, and said her administration will handle cross-Straits ties in accordance with the “Constitution of the Republic of China”, the “Regulations on Relations between People in the Taiwan and Mainland Areas” and other relevant laws.China Daily’s editorial points out that these “regulations” also “contain a mention of ‘national unification’”.Tsai’s speech did little to calm fears about future relations with Taiwan. “It left too many crucial questions unanswered,” the editorial concluded.
