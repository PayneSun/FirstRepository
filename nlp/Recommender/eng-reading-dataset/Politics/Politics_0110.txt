Nonfiction author nabs Nobel
The Nobel Prize for Literature has gone to non-fiction writers only a few times in its 105-year history, but this year for the first time, the eminent prize was given for journalistic work, to Belarusian journalist and writer Svetlana Alexievich.The Swedish Academy announced on Oct 8 that 67-year-old Alexievich won the prize “for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time”. Alexievich has published six books in Russian since 1985, telling stories about the political upheavals during and after the Soviet Union era, and about the tragedies they unleashed on individuals.Alexievich started her journalistic career as a newspaper reporter in Belarus. Her works, often told through the voices of eyewitnesses, victims and survivors, covered such dramatic historical events as World War II, the Soviet-Afghan War, the fall of the former Soviet Union, and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.For decades, Alexievich has won international accolade for portraying war and suffering through the eyes of women and children. Her first book, War’s Unwomanly Face, published in 1985, contained monologues from women who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II.The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine had particularly painful, personal significance for Alexievich. Her sister was killed, and her mother blinded in the tragic incident. In 1997, Alexievich published a highly praised oral history on the disaster, Voices from Chernobyl.Despite the Nobel win, Alexievich remains a controversial figure. According to an article in salon.com, she left her home in Belarus in 2000 due to persecution, and lived in various European cities over the following decade.War’s Unwomanly Face was banned in the former Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years.Over the years, Alexievich has been a critic of Russia and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
