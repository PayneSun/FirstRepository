Trump visit marks strong relationship
With an elaborate welcome ceremony at Beijing Capital International Airport and a tour arranged at the Forbidden City, President Xi Jinping gave his US counterpart Donald Trump what Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai called a “state visit plus” welcome at the beginning of his three-day visit from Nov 8 to 10.During their tour of the Palace Museum, spanning the afternoon and evening, Xi and Trump exchanged views on issues of common concern, such as governance and China-US ties, as they toured the imperial halls, watched repair work on cultural relics and enjoyed Peking Opera.The Forbidden City has been frequently included in foreign leaders’ itineraries (行程) on their visits to Beijing in recent decades. But it is the first time that the museum has simultaneously hosted the Chinese president and his wife accompanying a visiting presidential couple from another country, according to Shan Jixiang, director of the museum.Ruan Zongze, vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the special treatment for Trump represents the shared determination and actions of both China and the US to improve China-US ties.The visit is of great significance in pushing forward the steady development of China-US relations in the new era and promoting the prosperity of not only the Asia-Pacific region but also the world, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a news conference on Nov 7.“It is true that China and the United States do not see eye-to-eye on every issue, but the wisdom and foresight that the leaders of the two countries showed during this visit provided strategic guidance for the development of relations,” commented China Daily.The mutual interests of the world’s two largest economies, which are also one another’s largest trading partner, have paved the way for growing cooperation. On Nov 8 alone, US and Chinese companies signed 19 deals worth $9 billion.And they worked hard to address specific differences on diplomatic and security issues, trade and the economy, social and people-to-people issues, and law enforcement and cyber security in the first round of high-level talks agreed at the Mar-a-Lago meeting between Xi and Trump in Florida in April.Certainly, by reaching new agreements, they can inject fresh impetus into the development of China-US relations for the new era. Not only will this benefit both countries, but it will also benefit the international community if these two powerful nations work together for the common good.
