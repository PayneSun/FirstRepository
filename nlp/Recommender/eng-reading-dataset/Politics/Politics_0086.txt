Trump comments cause slump
As the Republican front-runner for 2016 US presidential nomination, Donald Trump has faced setbacks in the past few weeks. On April 3, he lost an important primary in Wisconsin. Critics speculate that Trump’s low poll numbers were linked to several off-color comments he made prior to the primary.In an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, Trump suggested “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who have abortions–a comment that surely alienated many female voters.Then, in an interview with The New York Times published on March 26, Trump suggested that the US’ Asian allies shoulder more of the burden for regional defense. He encouraged countries like South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear arsenals–a comment that, according to many critics, reveals how little he knows about international politics.Trump has made trade a focal point in his campaign. He boasted he would negotiate “tough new trade deals” and “bring jobs back” to the US. He lambasted US companies such as Ford and Apple that have moved some or most of their manufacturing overseas. But in response, critics noted that he is guilty of the same practice in his businesses.According to a Financial Times report, many of Donald Trump’s apparel products, including its shirts, ties, cuff links and eyeglass frames, are manufactured in China.
