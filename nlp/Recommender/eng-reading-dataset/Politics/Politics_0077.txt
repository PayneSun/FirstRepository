Coup ends in failure
Violence shook Turkey’s two main cities, Istanbul and Ankara, on July 15, as a *coup by rebels using tanks and helicopters tried to *topple President Tayyip Erdogan.At least 290 people were killed, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on July 16. The death toll includes at least 190 civilians and 100 coup supporters.The coup attempt crumbled as Erdogan rushed back to Istanbul from a Mediterranean holiday and urged people to take to the streets to support his government. Around 6,000 people had been detained in “cleanup operations”, reported Arab News on July 18.Foreign Affairs writer Brian Klaus deemed the coup’s failure a predictable one, despite the fact that Turkish military officers have successfully staged four coups since the 1960s.“Successful coups usually follow one of two pathways. Either the military establishment uniformly agrees from the outset that a military takeover should proceed, or a smaller group of *audacious coup plotters within the military finds a way to create a *bandwagon effect, wherein rank-and-file soldiers and the military brass rally around the plot,” Klaus wrote.The four previous successful coups in Turkey fit these pathways–the military was united, they had popular support, and they responded to the threat of religious *radicalization. But none of that applied this time. It was reported that the commander of Turkey’s military was not even part of the coup but was instead being held hostage by *rogue elements within the army. At a later stage of the coup, a much larger part of the military began to fight back against the plot, leading ultimately to its failure.
