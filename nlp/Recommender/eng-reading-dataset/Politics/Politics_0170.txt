Carla Bruni-Sarkozy pregnant?
The Elysee Palace on Sunday fuelled rife speculation in France that Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the first lady, has fallen pregnant with a long-expected first child by the French leader.Newspapers across the political spectrum on Sunday reported that the 43-year-old former model was expecting a first child with President Nicolas Sarkozy, 56, whom she married following a whirlwind romance in 2008.Neither the Elysee Palace nor senior ministers denied the claims. A spokesman said the matter was part of the couple’s private life and there would be no official statement.The latest edition of French Closer magazine reported under the headline "Pregnant at last", that sources were "absolutely certain" about the information.Closer claimed Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy is in the early weeks of pregnancy’, meaning the child would be born just as the next presidential campaign hits its stride.Mr Sarkozy hopes to be returned to the Elysee Palace for a second term next spring.The magazine said ministers were informed of the pregnancy but warned not to leak the news because the condition is in early stages and ’fragile’.Closer has run similar rumours before but newspapers, including Le Journal du Dimanche, Le Parisien, and Le Figaro, have also given the story credibility.The right-wing Le Figaro is particularly close to Mr Sarkozy.Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy has often spoken of her desire to have children with Mr Sarkozy, explaining: "I hope to, if I am young enough. It would be a dream."Over the Christmas period Ms Bruni-Sarkozy visited a shrine in India and told a Muslim cleric that she was praying for another son.In an online report, Le Figaro points to the fact that it is the third time in three years that the press has suggested that Ms Bruni-Sarkozy might be pregnant. It also suggests that the First Lady’s mother, Marisa, rejected the Closer story as untrue.An unnamed senior minister told Le Journal du Dimanche there was no comment to make on the subject.
