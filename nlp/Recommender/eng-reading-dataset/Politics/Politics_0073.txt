Blast boy inspires discussion
Once again, an image of a boy has become a symbol of Syria’s wartime suffering.But amid a worldwide outpouring of grief and outrage at the sight of the child, Omran Daqneesh – a small, silent, solitary figure, showed bloodied and dazed in the back of an ambulance following an attack on his ravaged hometown of Aleppo.Video and pictures of Omran, taken just after he was *plucked from the *rubble of his family home in the aftermath of an air strike on Aug 17, *ricocheted across social media. Dust-covered, the little boy doesn’t cry. He just stares straight ahead, his small face expressionless with shock.For many who saw the images, they couldn’t help but be reminded of the Syrian *toddler whose tiny drowned corpse washed up on a Turkish beach almost 12 months ago.Though some media alleged the video and pictures of Omran may have been faked, children in Syria often *bear the brunt of the violence, *deprived of education, *malnourished, dying of easily preventable diseases and vulnerable to the constant bombardment.But even amid the *ravages of Syria’s five-year conflict, the *plight of Aleppo stands out. Fighting has raged on in recent weeks between government forces and rebels, each of which claims control in separate parts of the city.Trapped civilians are enduring hunger, power cuts and air strikes by government forces, and medical care is harder and harder to come by. In the city’s opposition-held areas, at least two dozen medical facilities have been hit by government air strikes, according to United Nations investigators.In Geneva on Aug 18, the UN envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, cut short a meeting of the humanitarian task force saying that there was no point in continuing unless there was a break in fighting so that much-needed aid convoys could complete their journeys. He said: “Not one single humanitarian convoy has so far reached any of the *besieged areas this month–not one single convoy, and why? Because of one thing: fighting.”
