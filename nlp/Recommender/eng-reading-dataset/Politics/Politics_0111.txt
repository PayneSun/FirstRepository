Nobel win honors scientist
Tu Youyou, an 84-year-old female scientist, became the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize in science on Oct 5. While the news has stirred China’s national pride, it has also highlighted differences in prize-awarding practices between China and the world.Tu, a researcher at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, shared the 2015 Nobel Prize for Medicine with Irish-born William Campbell and Satoshi Omura of Japan for unlocking revolutionary treatments for parasitic diseases. Campbell and Omura were honored for their anti-roundworm treatment, while Tu came up with a new drug for malaria.Tu conducted research in the 1970s that led to the discovery of artemisinin, a drug that has considerably cut the number of malaria deaths and saved millions of lives. The treatment is based on an herb used in Chinese traditional medicine, called sweet wormwood. Artemisinin-based drugs are now the standard treatment for malaria.When news broke that Tu was being awarded the prize, there were cheers as well as doubts. Some said the achievement was the result of collective efforts by lots of Chinese scientists, so it is unfair to award the prize only to Tu, China Youth Daily reported.Indeed, domestic science awards are primarily presented to projects, instead of individual scientists, the newspaper pointed out.But Western awards tend to honor individual scientists who are the first to come up with a new idea or method, said Li Zhenzhen, a researcher with the China Academy of Sciences. “The West believes that the advancement of science originates from individuals’ creative minds,” said Li.Tu got the award for three “firsts”. She was the first to bring artemisinin to her project team, the first to extract a form of artemisinin that can altogether inhibit malaria, and the first to complete a clinical trial, according to Zhang Boli, director of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.“Awarding prizes to scientists with creative ideas is the source of national innovation,” Li suggested. “The key is to create fair rules to find the most convincing candidate.”
