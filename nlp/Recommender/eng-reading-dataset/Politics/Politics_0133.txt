Prince George christening
He was on his best behaviour. With the eyes of the world on him, His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander Louis put on a perfect display of royal etiquette.In an historic ceremony which brought together four generations of the Royal Family, the three-month-old future king was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace yesterday.Dressed in a handmade replica of Queen Victoria’s daughter’s christening robe, George bore a striking resemblance to his father at a similar age.According to aides, there wasn’t ‘even a peep’ out of the three-month-old future king as he was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace.‘He went in smiling, came out smiling and, as far as we are aware, smiled throughout,’ said one. William, however, could not resist confiding: ‘It’s the first time he’s been quiet all day.’The Archbishop of Canterbury told the congregation that George’s parents and godparents had a ‘simple task’ – to ‘make sure he knows who this Jesus is’.The simplicity of the half-hour ceremony contrasted with the historic grandeur of the surroundings.
