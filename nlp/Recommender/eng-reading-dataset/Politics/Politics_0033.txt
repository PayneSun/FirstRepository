Documentary inspires public confidence in national achievements
A documentary has chronicled China’s economic and social progress over the past five years, as the world’s second largest economy is gearing up for a key Party congress this month.A six-episode series "Amazing China" highlights innovation, coordination, greening, opening up and inclusiveness since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012.The first two episodes that have been aired focused on infrastructure -- bridges, expressways, high speed rail -- and new ideas such as shared bikes, mobile payments and aerospace technology."People have felt the benefit of the progress," said Shen Yi, deputy director of Fudan University cyberspace governance study center.The 19th CPC National Congress will be held this month.Over the past five years, despite a global economic slowdown, China’s economy is stable and has seen an average annual GDP growth of 7.2 percent from 2013 to 2016.Now, China has the world’s longest sea bridge, the largest 4G network, the longest highway network and the longest high-speed rail network.The mileage of the high-speed rail totals 22,000 kilometers, exceeding the other top ten countries combined. Nearly 60 percent of the network was built in the past five years.For Tian Guangdong, head of an entrepreneurship park, the documentary filled him with new ideas."I found philosophies in the second episode that could be applied to our projects," he said.Over the past five years, Chinese leaders have underscored the significance of innovation for the country’s science and technology development."The support of the government for innovation is heartily welcomed, breeding a burst of entrepreneurship among the public," said Shen.The documentary said China sold around 90,000 industrial robots last year and has become a leader in supercomputers, aerospace, maritime engineering, logistics and mobile payments.Over 2.65 million overseas students had returned to China by the end of 2016, 70 percenter since the 18th CPC National Congress, according to the documentary. These returnees will be a mainstay to fulfilling the Party’s two centennial goal."The documentary shows the Party’s determination to achieve those goals and public confidence in the Party," said Shen.
