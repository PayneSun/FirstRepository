Historic DPRK-US meeting takes place
The day of June 12 saw a historic meeting, which caught the global spotlight.Top leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump met in Singapore on the resort island of Sentosa.Singapore was chosen as the place for the summit because the Southeast Asian nation has a relationship with both the US and the DPRK, according to White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah.The summit marked the first ever meeting between the DPRK’s top leader and a sitting US president since the 1950-53 Korean War.After the summit, the two leaders signed a “comprehensive” joint statement. The US would be committed to providing security guarantees to the DPRK in exchange for Pyongyang’s commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.The statement also states that the US and the DPRK will establish new relations and build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.“We are prepared to start a new history and we are ready to write a new chapter between our nations,” Trump told a news conference after the summit.For his part, Kim said: “We had a historic meeting today and we decided to leave the past behind. The world will see a major change.”Since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, the DPRK and the US had been locked in confrontational behavior.But things took a big turn this year when the DPRK sent its athletes to participate in the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.Later, Kim made two trips to China, and also met with Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in twice in one month. He also extended an invitation to Trump for a meeting, which was accepted by the US president.In late May, Trump suddenly decided to pull out of the summit. In a letter to Kim, the US leader said he felt it “inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting”.Now that the two leaders have finally had their handshake, however, the world is waiting to see what happens next.According to Lee Sang-man, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies of Kyungnam University in Seoul, the fact that Kim and Trump sat down at the same table and talked is “epoch-making”.“The DPRK-US summit itself [is] a first step toward opening a new era of [a] denuclearized Korean Peninsula,” he said.
