Enslaved fishermen saved
Chinese social media exploded last week with news about a prestigious culture award in the US – the Pulitzer Prize.Much of the attention was focused on one of the winners: “Seafood from slaves”, an investigation by The Associated Press (AP) that won the award for public service.It is a series of stories recording how the fishing industry in Southeast Asia used slave labor to put seafood in kitchens and restaurants in the US, and around the world.AP correspondent Martha Mendoza was one of the lead reporters for the yearlong investigation. After the series was released last year, NPR did a profile of Mendoza and the team’s work. NPR explains that the AP discovered “dozens of men being held against their will on Benjina, a remote Indonesian island, which serves as the base for a trawler fleet that fishes in the area”.When the AP’s team went to the island, they found men held in cages so that they wouldn’t run away. “They were trapped. They had no way to go home; they had not heard from their family in five, ten years,” Mendoza said.These modern-day slaves were mostly from Myanmar. Some of them were lured by promises of a job, while others were kidnapped and forced to work.After the AP reporters made this discovery, they began tracking where the seafood went. They watched the seafood get loaded into a cargo ship, then used GPS to track it to a port in Thailand.The seafood was offloaded into some 150 trucks. The reporters followed as many of those trucks as they could, jotting down the names of the plants where the seafood was delivered.Then the AP dug into customs records to see which of those plants were shipping seafood into the US. A lot of the seafood ended up in major supermarket chains including Wal-Mart and Safeway.The reporting eventually freed 2,000 slaves, brought perpetrators to justice and caused industry reforms.
