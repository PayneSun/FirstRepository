China unites for Party Congress
When Wang Kerui went hiking with her classmates last year, she picked up almost every piece of rubbish she saw along each path.For the 16-year-old sophomore from No 1 Middle School in Wulian, Shandong province, clearing up rubbish is a kind of family tradition that she learned from her father, who is a teacher and member of the Communist Party of China (CPC).As there are several scenic spots around her hometown, Wang and her family often see rubbish left by tourists. Her father, who joined the CPC to serve the people and repay society, often goes to clean up the rubbish himself. Wang remembers the first time she joined her father to clear up litter when she was just a child.This experience taught her the power of faith in the CPC.Wang, who is currently a member of the Communist Youth League, aims to eventually be a member of the CPC in order to serve the people.“To be a member of the CPC is a very honorable thing. It paves the way for me to dedicate myself to the country and fight for the cause of communism,” she said.To enable herself to become a qualified Party member, Wang always follows the latest news about the Party and the country. Currently, the most important event on China’s calendar is the 19th CPC National Congress, which will begin on Oct 18 in Beijing.A total of 2,287 delegates will attend the upcoming congress. They have been chosen to represent every CPC member across China, of which there are over 89 million. These delegates not only come from traditional industries like manufacturing, transportation, steel and coal, but also from sectors such as finance, online, and social organizations.The election of delegates started in November 2016 after the CPC Central Committee stated the quota of delegates, their qualifications and the election procedure.During the congress, delegates will listen to and examine reports from the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), express the voices of Party members and the general public, discuss and decide on major issues of the Party, as well as elect a new CPC Central Committee and a new CCDI.
