Time's Person of the Year is 'the Protester'
“No one could have known that when a Tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire in a public square, it would incite protests that would topple dictators and start a global wave of dissent. In 2011, protesters didn’t just voice their complaints; they changed the world. ”TIME’s universal image of The Protester symbolizes the Middle Eastern protesters, African protesters, Mexican drug cartel protesters, Greek protesters, international Occupy movement protesters and Russian protesters that defined the revolutionary spirit of 2011.The TIME Person of the Year has continued to be an annual hallmark since 1927, when Charles Lindbergh was the first person honored with the distinctive TIME magazine cover.TIME conducted its annual poll last month, which offered a list of 34 candidates. The magazine’s runners-up for 2011 Person of the Year are:Admiral William McRaven, who organized the raid that took down Osama bin Laden.Congressman Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who sounded the alarm on U.S. national debt.Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, formerly Kate Middleton, currently the wife of Prince William.Why exactly did TIME select the global body of protesters as its 2011 Person of the Year? Because the protesters are "redefining people power."
