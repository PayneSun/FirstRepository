Benefits of membership apparent
Dec 11 marked the 15th anniversary of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).On that day in 2001, China formally became the WTO’s 143rd member. Now the country has grown into the world’s second-largest economy and the largest trading country, while millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty.And 15 years on, it’s evident that being a WTO member has transformed the nation’s everyday lives for the better.Imports are now a common sight in Chinese stores and supermarkets, while they were previously rarely seen on shelves. The Chinese now have access to many imports varying from luxury goods like high-end cars and famous brand watches, to daily commodities like vegetables and fruits.China’s WTO membership has also made imports less expensive for the Chinese public. For instance, since 2005, no tariffs have been imposed on Chinese imports of digital cameras and video game *consoles, along with other devices. This, coupled with the relocation of foreign manufacturers of these products to China, has made them less expensive.Our education industry has also benefited from China’s WTO membership. Many top global universities have joined forces with Chinese ones to establish cooperative education institutions, bringing foreign teaching concepts to Chinese students.For example, New York University Shanghai was jointly founded by New York University and East China Normal University.In addition, an increasing number of Chinese students are furthering their studies abroad, while many foreign students are coming to China to carry out their higher education. According to the Ministry of Education, 523,700 students studied overseas last year, and the number is expected to keep growing this year.China’s WTO entry has brought benefits not only to the country’s people, but also for the rest of the world.China has long been vital in helping shore up world economic growth, especially in the *aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite slower expansion in recent years, China still contributes 25 percent to the growth of the world’s economy.And as China plans to be more *proactive in opening up to the outside world, its stable growth is anticipated to produce even more benefits for the world.
