Mission to Mars unveiled on first Space Day
China marked its first ever Space Day on April 24, the day its first satellite Dongfanghong-1 launched into space in 1970.A range of events was held across China, after the State Council announced in late March that, starting this year, the country would celebrate this occasion. And one of the highlights was a press conference on April 22, during which Xu Dazhe, head of the China National Space Administration, said the central government approved a Mars mission. As part of this newly unveiled plan, an unmanned probe will be sent to orbit and land on the Red Planet in 2020.It’s a challenging task. Since the 1960s, different countries have sent more than 40 probes to Mars, and only 19 accomplished their missions. If China’s probe succeeds in landing on Mars, it will conduct scientific research on the Martian soil, environment, atmosphere and water, opening a new chapter in the country’s deep-space exploration program.Apart from the Mars mission, Xu also revealed a series of other space exploration plans. China will launch about 150 of its Long March carrier rockets over the next five years. There were 86 Long March missions in the five years from 2011 to 2015, and 48 from 2006 to 2010.Chen Xuechuan, assistant president of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, told Xinhua News Agency that China is quickly catching up with other countries after being a relative latecomer in human space endeavors.The launch of the SJ-10 retrievable scientific research satellite earlier this month marked the 226th mission of the Long March rocket family, and the pace of the launches is accelerating.“Our first 100 Long March missions took us 37 years. But it only took us seven years to complete the latest 100,” Chen said.
