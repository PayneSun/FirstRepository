Ivanka Trumpâ€™s Spring Festival presence welcome
US first daughter Ivanka Trump and her daughter came to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC last Wednesday night to attend a Spring Festival celebration. Her appearance attracted wide attention.Customarily, American presidents usually send greetings at lunar new year, but this time US President Donald Trump broke with tradition, letting his acting Secretary of State Tom Shannon do the job instead. Whether US presidents send greetings at Chinese lunar new year does not impact the festival mood among Chinese, except perhaps those in the US.Among the recent first families of the US, Ivanka Trump is regarded as the most influential first daughter, whose words and deeds are also believed to carry more weight. Her appearance at the Chinese Embassy, with a certain political and diplomatic significance, could be invigorating to the China-US relationship.Trump is clear that China will certainly take retaliatory measures against his provocations, and is calculating the difficulties and costs of going up against China.During the first weeks of his presidency, Trump has further split US society and rocked the world as he worked to fulfill his campaign promises, such as abolishing healthcare reform, withdrawing from the TPP free trade deal, proposing a US-Mexico wall and issuing the travel ban. The intensified support and opposition Trump received have reached a fragile balance during the early days of his tenure. Hitting out against China will be a risky move, for which Trump needs to find a good reason and be certain about the benefits.The excuses that Trump made to cause a deterioration in the Sino-US relationship have been weighed up by US society and cannot spur Americans. Meanwhile, Trump is clear his toughness against Chinese will incur equally tough reactions from China.If clashes break out between Beijing and Washington under Trump, which side the Western mainstream public opinion would support is hard to predict.China cherishes peace, but is also well-prepared to fight for peace. While Beijing fully respects Trump, his team and his family, we should resolutely fight against his provocations.
