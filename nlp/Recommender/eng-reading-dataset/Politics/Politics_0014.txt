US bans Chinese tech giant ZTE
A recent decision made by the US government has caused a big stir.On April 16, the US Department of Commerce announced that it would impose a seven-year ban on China’s telecommunications-gear maker ZTE’s purchase of core US technologies, including computer chips.The ban is the latest development in the US government’s punishment of ZTE, after the company pleaded guilty in 2017 to violating US sanctions by shipping telecom equipment to Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Since then, ZTE has paid fines and penalties.But US officials say the company has not kept its promise to discipline 35 employees, leading to their decision to ban ZTE.In response, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it is ready to take necessary measures to safeguard the rights and interests of Chinese companies, and it urged the US to create a fair environment for all players.On April 20, ZTE said it wouldn’t accept the US’ ban on the company, which it called “extremely unfair”, adding that the US has ignored its efforts to comply with the country’s export control laws and regulations.The case triggered in-depth discussions focused on the urgency for China to support development of its own core technologies in the telecommunications industry.In recent years, China has spent more than $200 billion on imported chips annually – more than the amount spent on crude oil (原油) imports – said Wang Zhihua, a microelectronics professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.For Hu Weiwu, who is in charge of Loongson, China’s first general-purpose microprocessor with intellectual property rights, this crisis could be turned into something positive.“We can turn the ZTE crisis into an opportunity to raise public awareness of the importance of processors and ramp up our push to promote the use of China-developed chips,” Hu said.In fact, many efforts have already been made. In 2014, China set up a fund worth around 138 billion yuan to support promising local chip companies in an attempt to reduce its reliance on US chip giants such as Qualcomm and Intel.And more efforts will be made. “China will continue to reform and open up further. By making good use of technological resources both domestically and internationally, it will achieve independent innovation while benefiting the world,” commented People’s Daily. “The road is long, but the goal is attainable under diligent efforts.”
