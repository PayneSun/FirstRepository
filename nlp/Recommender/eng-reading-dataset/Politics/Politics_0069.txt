Heritage should be remembered
A national list of architectural masterpieces was released in Beijing on Sept 29 to remind people of the country’s disappearing heritage.Ninety-eight sites were *inscribed into the first edition of the 20th-Century Chinese Architectural Heritage List, which was drafted by the Chinese Society of Cultural Relics and the Architectural Society of China.Landmark architecture of New China, like the Great Hall of the People and the Monument to the People’s Heroes, ranked high up on the list.Renowned Western-style architecture from the early 20th century was also included, such as the Bund in Shanghai, the Russian-style Saint Sofia Cathedral in Harbin, Heilongjiang, and Tianjin’s Marco Polo Square, a former Italian community.College campuses also play host to notable architecture. Old buildings at Tsinghua University, Nanjing University and Wuhan University are among some of the buildings that made the list.“Many of the included structures have abundant stories and are witnesses of historical *vicissitude, and they are thus alive,” said Shan Jixiang, head of the Chinese Society of Cultural Relics. “However, more historical communities from the 20th century outside the list are endangered.”He added that the new list will work as a way to make people more aware of preserving more recent architectural sites for future generations.“When restoring them, they should be treated as cultural heritage sites rather than general construction. Otherwise, historical information will be *irreversibly lost,” he said.As an architect, Shan criticized the way China became a playground for foreign designers’ *maverick blueprints in the first decade of the 21st century.“Masterpieces of the 20th century prove that Chinese architects’ spirit and techniques are well inherited,” he said. “And they deserve to be passed on to modern times.”“The list shows that a new type has been added into categories of immovable cultural heritage sites,” said Gu Yucai, deputy director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage. “This meets common practice in the rest of world.”
