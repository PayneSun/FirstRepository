Victory for open trials
If you suspect one of your friends has done something bad to you, what do you do? Rush over to grill that friend, or give the friend an opportunity to tell his or her side of the story?Obviously, the latter would be the wisest choice if you want to figure things out amicably. In the legal world, this is part of what jurists call the “procedural justice”.It is the notion that fair procedures are more likely to lead to fair outcomes. To make procedures fair, those carrying out the procedures must be impartial and neutral, legal experts say. Also, those directly affected by the decisions should have a voice and representation in the process. Finally, to ensure a fair procedure, the process must be transparent and open.A court trial in Beijing that was broadcast live on the Web has sparked lively discussions about this concept.On Jan 7 and 8, four executives from Shenzhen QVOD Technology Co Ltd, an online video streaming company, stood trial at the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court, China Daily reported.They are accused of making a profit from the video site, while turning a blind eye to the large amounts of pornography that had been uploaded, downloaded and watched through their service, said prosecutors. The defendants denied the charges. A verdict will be handed down later.The trial reflects the principle of procedural justice and China’s progress in judicial reform, according to Xinhua News Agency.During the court hearing, the executives did a good job of defending themselves. “The plausible points that the defendants and their lawyers made have tilted public opinion in the defendants’ favor,” an opinion piece from China Daily noted.“As far as procedural justice is concerned, the argument the defendants made warrants further investigation and proper evaluation of the evidence.”“No matter whether the defendants are guilty or not, we should respect procedural justice and applaud their impressive defense, which is what the rule of law requires,” Xinhua pointed out.
