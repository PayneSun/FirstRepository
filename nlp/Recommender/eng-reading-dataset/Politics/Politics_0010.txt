When he took the helm of the White House, Barack Obama was called the “first social media president”. Now in his post-White House days, the former US president and his wife Michelle Obama have moved on to work in digital media.Last month, the US entertainment company Netflix announced that the couple had signed a multiyear agreement to produce movies and series for the company. The two will create “a diverse mix of content, including the potential for scripted series, unscripted series, documentaries, and features”, according to Netflix.The Obamas’ productions will mainly focus on inspiring content. “One of the simple joys of our time in public service was getting to meet so many amazing people from all walks of life, and to help them share their experiences with a wider audience,” the former president said in a statement. “We hope to curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples.”
