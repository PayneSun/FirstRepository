Late founder remembered
Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore and one of postwar Asia’s most revered and controversial politicians, passed away at 91 early in the morning on March 23, the Singaporean government announced.Lee, a Cambridge-educated lawyer of Chinese descent, led Singapore from 1959 to 1990 and remained a member of parliament after leaving the office of prime minister. He resigned as “Minister Mentor” in 2011. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is Singapore’s third and current prime minister.“To many Singaporeans, and indeed others too, Lee Kuan Yew was Singapore,” Lee Hsien Loong said in a televised address to the nation’s 5.4 million people. President Xi Jinping praised Lee as an “old friend of the Chinese people” and said he was widely respected by the international community as a strategist and a statesman.Lee oversaw Singapore’s independence from Britain and separation from Malaysia. A New York Times article says that Lee saw himself in a never-ending struggle to overcome the nation’s lack of natural resources, a potentially hostile international environment and a volatile ethnic mix of Chinese, Malays and Indians.Lee cemented Singapore’s status as the most business-friendly location in the region by eliminating corruption and building a politically neutral jurisdiction based on the British legal system. A BBC obituary says: “His greatest achievement was to promote the concept of good governance in Southeast Asia, a region long plagued by corrupt, inefficient governments.”Up the ladderThat helped propel Singapore from an economically adrift port city in the 1950s with a per-capita gross domestic product of just $550 to an Asian financial powerhouse with a GDP per-capita of $55,000, says a Financial Times article, citing data from the World Bank.Lee was famous for his “Singapore model”, sometimes criticized by the West as soft authoritarianism, including centralized power, clean government and economic liberalism.Lee was a master of “Asian values”, a concept in which the government adopts a paternal role and the good of society took precedence over the rights of the individual. His strict rule was reflected in the clean, modern and affluent city that Singapore is today. With low taxes, good schools, low crime and investment-friendly laws, Singapore became a popular place for international businesses to base their employees and operations focused on Southeast Asia and East Asia.A New York Times article says Singapore reflected Lee: efficient, unsentimental, incorrupt, inventive, forward-looking and pragmatic.On the international stage, Lee’s sharp intellect meant his advice was sought by US presidents from Lyndon B Johnson to Barack Obama, and by European leaders such as Helmut Schmidt, the former West German chancellor with whom he remained close, according to the Financial Times.He was one of the first to spot the potential of China under Deng Xiaoping, the former Chinese leader whose pro-market reforms unleashed the economic juggernaut that is now the world’s largest economy on purchasing parity terms, says the Financial Times.
