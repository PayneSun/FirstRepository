Stand out with stylish socks
While a female politician or first lady can use her clothing to create a favorable public image, male politicians don’t have as many fashion choices to play with. But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems to have discovered a goldmine – his socks.He’s been seen wearing “statement socks” at many public events. For example, during a NATO meeting in Brussels in May, Trudeau wore one blue sock and one pink, both with the NATO symbol printed on them. And in June, he wore a pair of socks with the pattern of maple leaves – a national symbol of Canada – when he appeared on a TV show.The New York Times’ editor Vanessa Friedman praised Trudeau’s play on his socks as “clever”.“[Socks] are subtle enough not to be distracting, but visible enough that you can’t miss the point,” she wrote. “Rarely have a man’s ankles said so much.”But not all the playful socks that Trudeau wears send some kind of political message – some of them are just for fun.One example is a pair he wore during a meeting with Enda Kenny, then the prime minister of Ireland, in Montreal on May 4. During their meeting, Trudeau wore Star Wars socks – simply because that day happened to be International Star Wars Day. If this pair of socks sent out any message, according to Vogue magazine reporter Emily Farra, that message was “just that he has a quirky side and loves George Lucas films,” she wrote.However, some say that 45-year-old Trudeau’s unusual sock choices show a childish side of the prime minister that proves he isn’t mature enough to be the leader of a country.But Friedman doesn’t see it that way. “The socks have been a source of pride and applause on an international scale – a symbol both of Mr Trudeau’s ability to embrace multiculturalism and of his position as a next-generation leader not bound by old traditions,” she wrote. “[They have] opened up possibilities for the future.”
