Trump, Jack Ma talk about job creation for US
A meeting between Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma and US President-elect Donald Trump last Monday signals that Trump, whose tough stance on China has cast dark clouds over China-US trade relations, left a door open for pragmatic cooperation with Chinese companies, Chinese experts said.The Chinese billionaire reportedly held a meeting with Trump in New York on last Monday to discuss how the Chinese e-commerce giant could create jobs by allowing US businesses to sell products in the Chinese market.This was the first meeting of the US president-elect with a high profile businessman from China, following a barrage of tough rhetoric and actions, including threats to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods and selection of China critics for trade positions.Though details of the meeting as to what was specifically discussed remain sketchy, it is a positive signal for China-US trade relations under Trump, following the recent turbulence, according to Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation."This is a sign that Trump is leaving the door open for pragmatic cooperation with Chinese firms, which he thinks could help the US economy and create jobs," Bai told the Global Times.It is important that Alibaba strikes a balance between expanding overseas and strengthening its base in China, Mei noted.Bai said the meeting also offers a pattern that other Chinese companies can follow in expanding to the US under Trump. "They have to stress how many jobs you can create in the US in talking with Trump," he said.
