Moscow accused of hack
In an unusual move that may have serious *implications for both the US presidential election and US-Russian relations, Washington has officially accused Moscow of *interfering in the showdown for the US presidency between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Although the US Democratic Party said as early as June that Russian government hackers were behind the major leak of emails that embarrassed the Party leadership and Hillary Clinton, the White House did not immediately confirm the accusation, or join the *condemnation of Russia.But on Oct 7, just two days ahead of the second US presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, the Obama administration made public the official accusations.“The US Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,” said the administration in a statement. “These *thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.”Russia has denied any involvement in the hacking. Just hours after the accusations were published, whistle-blowing site WikiLeaks released thousands of emails stolen from a Clinton campaign official, including some that contained *excerpts from speeches Clinton made to Wall Street banks. The *revelations are expected to bring *embarrassment to Clinton, despite currently leading Trump by a comfortable *margin in the polls.
