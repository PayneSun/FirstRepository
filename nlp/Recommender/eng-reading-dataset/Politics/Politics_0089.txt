Cuba visit part of Obama’s legacy
US President Barack Obama is in Cuba from March 20 to 22 for a historic visit to the island, reported China Daily.He is the first sitting US president to visit Cuba in 88 years. The move is seen as a landmark gesture, aimed at ending the long-lasting tension between the two neighbors. They haven’t had normalized relations since the Communist leader Fidel Castro overthrew a pro-American government in 1959.Obama’s visit to Cuba is seen as “seeking to leave a historic foreign policy mark in his final year in office,” AFP reported. Jeffrey Goldberg, a correspondent for The Atlantic magazine, said that Obama’s other major foreign policy achievements include the Paris climate-change agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.“Though he has a reputation for prudence, he has also been eager to question some of the long-standing assumptions undergirding traditional US foreign-policy thinking,” Goldberg wrote.Goldberg asserts that, unlike his predecessors, Obama is willing to question how the US chooses its enemies and its friends. He challenges the existing norms. “He overthrew half a century of bipartisan consensus in order to reestablish ties with Cuba,” Goldberg wrote.Also, according to the article, Obama is “fixated on turning America’s attention towards Asia”, because “Asia represents the future”.As for China, Obama says he believes the relationship between the two countries is going to be the most critical, “in terms of traditional great-state relations”.“If China continues on a peaceful rise, then we have a partner that is growing in capability and sharing with us the burdens and responsibilities of maintaining an international order,” Obama said.
