Royal Family keeps up
Ever since UK’s Prince Harry and US actress Meghan Markle started dating in July 2016, they’ve been the focal point of the world. And now, the news of their engagement on Nov 28 is everywhere.Markle’s identity as non-royalty and as a mixed-raced woman – her father is a white man and her mother an African-American woman – has of course been one of the reasons why the couple has been attracting the world’s attention. But let’s admit it, the UK Royal Family has just never stopped being popular.One of the reasons is that the Royal Family knows how to move with the times. Once upon a time, kings, queens, princes and princesses were mysterious. Today, while they still have some of the old mystery, the royals are true celebrities, just like famous sports and pop stars. Indeed, they are the upper class of celebrities. There are hundreds of Hollywood actors, but there is only one Queen of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth II, or Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton.Because they’re seen so much – in magazines, on TV, on the internet – the royals must now be careful. It’s not enough to be famous; one must “deserve” this fame. That’s why the new, younger generation of royals are so important to the Royal Family’s chances of surviving. An attractive and highly likeable young woman, Middleton’s support of so many good causes has given the Royal Family something that it needed.And now with Markle about to become a new member, the family is thrilled. Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, joked that “America’s loss is our gain”, according to BBC News.
