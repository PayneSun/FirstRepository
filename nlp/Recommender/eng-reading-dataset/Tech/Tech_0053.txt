Private company aims for the moon
A commercial space company could be one step closer to landing its spacecraft on the moon, in a regulatory move that might help open space exploration beyond Earth’s orbit to private firms.The Wall Street Journal reported early this month that US regulators were set to give “mission approval” to the California-based company Moon Express to land its MX-1 lander on the moon and to conduct a two-week operation. Previously, only nations have launched missions beyond Earth’s orbit.The Journal said official action coordinated through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which licenses and approves all commercial rocket launches, could come in the next few weeks.A mission like the one Moon Express is planning has to climb a unique set of regulatory hurdles. For one thing, Moon Express is subject to the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, an international regulatory agreement initiated by the US and Russia.The treaty mandates that the moon and other celestial bodies be used only for peaceful purposes and not for testing weapons of any kind. It also states that nongovernmental entities must get approval from a particular country for activities in outer space.Space pioneerSince all prior commercial activity has been within Earth’s orbit, Moon Express’ plan presents a new challenge for licensing and regulatory processes, said Mariel Borowitz, assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, US. She said the potential approval for Moon Express could provide a framework for the future licensing of private space activity such as SpaceX’s plans to go to Mars in 2018.“Moon Express, I think, is paving the way for commercial activity outside of Earth orbit,” Borowitz said.In a statement, the FAA said it is working through the interagency process to ensure a “mechanism is in place that permits emerging commercial space operations, such as the one that Moon Express has publicly commented on”.
