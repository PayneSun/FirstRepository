China’s ‘invisible’ new weapon
The test flight of the J-20 stealth fighter on January 11, was “a symbolic leap in China’s military modernization drive”, according to China Daily. The news has also excited many young Chinese, as it is China’s first stealth fighter. How exactly does stealth technology work? Simply speaking, stealth technology allows an aircraft to be partially invisible on radar or any other detection methods. It’s the principle of reflection and absorption that makes aircraft “stealthy”.Most conventional aircraft have a rounded shape, which creates a very efficient radar reflector. No matter where the radar signal hits the plane, some of the signal gets reflected back.A stealth aircraft, on the other hand, is made up of completely flat surfaces and very sharp edges. When a radar signal hits a stealth plane, the signal reflects away at an angle.Also, the surfaces on a stealth aircraft can be treated so they absorb radar signals. The overall result is that a stealth aircraft like an American F-117A reflects the radar signature of a small bird rather than an airplane.But stealth technology can’t make an aircraft fully invisible. It’s similar to the *camouflage *tactics used by soldiers in jungle *warfare. Unless the soldier comes near you, you can’t see him.The motive behind stealth technology is not just to allow planes to avoid missiles but also to give *deniability to *covert operations. In other words, we can say that the job of a stealth aircraft pilot is to not let others know that he was ever there.
