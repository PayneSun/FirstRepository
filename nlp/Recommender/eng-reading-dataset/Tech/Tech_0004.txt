Controlling our image
When we meet someone for the first time, we usually get a vague sense of what kind of person they are by the way they shake hands, talk, or walk. In the age of social networking, however, first impressions are sometimes made even before we actually meet someone in person – that is, by looking at their profile photo.According to a recent study, these social images say a lot about our personality.In the study, presented in a paper at the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, a group of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania in the US used software to analyze the profile pictures of 66,000 users of US social platform Twitter and 3,200 of their tweets. At the same time, about 434 participants were asked to complete a survey about their personality type.The researchers wanted to find out if there was a connection between personality traits – like openness, extroversion, and neuroticism – and a person’s profile picture.According to the results, open people are more likely to pose in an unusual way and use objects such as glasses or a guitar in their profile photo because they enjoy new and exciting experiences.Meanwhile, neurotic people often hold back their negative emotions. They try to avoid showing their face；instead, they use an image of something like a pet, a car or a building. That’s because neurotic people are strongly influenced by the “strong social norm against a very sad or angry appearance in profile pictures,” Daniel Preoiuc-Pietro from the University of Pennsylvania wrote in the research paper.Apart from the objects in profile pictures, the colors used in them also give us some hints about the photo’s owner.For example, extraverts were found to have the most colorful profile images, as they want to emphasize their personality and show themselves off, the researchers wrote.Although social media photos “usually represent an extension of one’s self, they also allow a user to shape his or her own personality and idealized view,” according to the researchers.So, when choosing a profile photo, maybe we should ask ourselves first what kind of image we’d like to convey. After all, first impressions always last.
