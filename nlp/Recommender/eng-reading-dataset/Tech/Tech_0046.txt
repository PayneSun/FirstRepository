China space dream rockets closer
“Becoming an *aerospace power has always been a dream we’ve been *striving for,” President Xi Jinping said on April 24, when Chinese aerospace scientists and engineers celebrated the country’s first Space Day.From its first satellite, Dongfanghong-1, all the way to soft-landing on the moon’s surface, China’s aerospace industry has made remarkable achievements.And on what is the country’s 60th anniversary of the start of space exploration, more plans have been revealed. What President Xi said is no longer a dream. China is well on its way to becoming a space superpower.In 2015 alone, China had 19 successful space launches – the second-highest behind Russia’s 26, and ahead of the US’ 18.Xu Dazhe, director of the China National Space Administration, said earlier this year that it was all part of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) to drive aerospace growth and have China play an active role in rule-making in new fields such as the internet, deep sea and *polar areas, as well as outer space.China will complete aerospace projects currently underway by around 2020, including manned space programs, *lunar probes, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and the Gaofen observation satellite program.Common roadmapHowever, China is not aiming to overshadow other countries. Despite being banned by US law from working with NASA on any manned outer space activities, China has been an active member of the International Space Exploration Coordination Group since 2006. The group is an international forum set up by 14 space agencies based on mutual interests, shared technologies and aims to plan a common, *cohesive roadmap into the future for all of mankind’s ventures into outer space.Through cooperation, China “gives a lot of countries a nice opportunity to develop new partnerships to stay active in space exploration”, Alanna Krolikowski, an expert in Chinese technology policy and visiting professor at the University of Gottingen in Germany, told Popular Science magazine.Solving global problems“The big dream of getting all nations working together in space is that the cooperation will extend back down to Earth. Trust developed through space co-exploration can also be turned to solving global problems like the environment, *pandemics, natural disasters and something as scary as a runaway asteroid with us in its crosshairs,” commented Chris Davis of China Daily.
