You may be eating the WRONG five-a-day fruit and veg, doctors say
Eating your five-a-day? Good for you. But are they the right five-a-day? Researchers say we should ditch carrots and oranges and buy some sweet potatoes and papaya instead. Our favourite fruits and vegetables are not necessarily the best for us, they claim. Rather than making up our five-a-day with foods we know and like, we should broaden our tastes and stock up on kale and blueberries, as well as sweet potatoes and papaya. Not only will our palates appreciate the variety, they are better for us than carrots, oranges and other favourites. The researchers focused on phytonutrients - plant compounds believed to boost the health of the eyes, bone, heart, brain and immune system, cutting the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes.They say that although carrots are rich in beta-carotene - a building block of flu-fighting vitamin A - sweet potatoes contain nearly twice as much. Similarly, while it is easy to start the day with a glass of orange juice, a handful of papaya contains 15 times more beta-cryptoxanthin - another vitamin A building block. Dr Keith Randolph, of U.S. vitamin pill manufacturer Nutrilite, said that while it was well known that many people do not eat enough fruit and vegetables, even those who ate the recommended five-a-day could do better. ’This data highlights the importance of not only the quantity but the significant impact that quality and variety of the fruits and vegetables can have.’ But Dr Emma Williams, of the British Nutrition Foundation, said: ’No food is a superfood if it is not part of a healthy, varied and balanced diet.’
