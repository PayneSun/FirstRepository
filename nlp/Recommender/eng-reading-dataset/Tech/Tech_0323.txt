Let’s run back over that unpleasant incident.Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao concluded his week-long official trip to Europe with an eventful day in Britain on 2 February 2009. As one of his last activities in Europe, Wen Jiabao visited Cambridge University in England where he delivered a speech stressing mutual understanding and cooperation.During his speech at a Cambridge University auditorium, Wen Jiabao was interrupted by a man in the audience. He blew a whistle and began shouting at the Chinese premier. Many in the audience were upset and told the man to get out.But instead the man threw his shoe, which landed far from Wen Jiabao on the floor. Pausing for a few seconds, Wen Jiabao calmly told the audience that the incident would do nothing to hold back the friendship of the Chinese and British people.University officials quickly removed the protester from the auditorium arresting him later on suspicion of a public order offense. On its website, the chancellor of Cambridge University released a statement regretting the man’s behavior saying the university is a place for considerate argument and debate, not for shoe-throwing. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also voiced dissatisfaction over the incident.
