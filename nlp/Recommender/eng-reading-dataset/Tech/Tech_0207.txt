Japan finds its own unique cure for snoring
A research group from Waseda University has come up a robotic bear that flips over people’s heads in their sleep to open their airways.The bear is used as a pillow, but has a built-in microphone.As soon as Jukusui-kun detects a loud snore, his paw reaches up (gently, at least in the brief video demo on display), and pushes the sleeper’s head to one side.The motion should push sufferers of sleep apnoea - the loud form of snoring that can be dangerous not only to relationships but to health - into a position where they no longer snore.The bear was shown off at the International Robot Show in Japan. Jukusui-kun means "deep sleep" - and the robot is targeted specifically at snorers whose snoring inhibits their blood oxygen level, with a separate hand monitor sensing when blood oxygen levels drop.The only problem is that not only do they have to sleep on a bear-shaped pillow with jointed robotic hands, they also have to insert their hand into another bear-shaped monitor which monitors blood oxygen.Monitors are also built into the sheet under the sleeper - the idea being that electrical cords would disturb sleep.The bear waits until low blood oxygen and loud snores indicate that the person sleeping on Jukusui-kun is snoring loudly, then the paw strikes.The bear is not yet on sale - and whether or not a robotic paw reaching up to turn one’s head over is any more effective than one’s partner shoving the person remains to be seen.
