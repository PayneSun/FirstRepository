Welcome to ‘Generation X’
It may be hard to believe, but this month marks a whole decade since Apple launched the original iPhone.In this time, the company has released many different models of its famous smartphone, with most of them setting an example for the rest of the industry.On Sept 13, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the company’s latest model, the iPhone X – pronounced “iPhone ten”. “It is the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” he told CNBC after the event at the company’s new headquarters in California, US.Of the several new features the iPhone X includes, its wireless charging ability is one of the most talked about. While wireless charging isn’t new to smartphones – US company Palm introduced it in 2009 – it’s a feature that many iPhone users have wanted for a long time.Now, instead of searching for the charging cable that’s fallen behind your bed, you can simply place your phone onto a wireless charging pad.Another feature, Face ID, replaces the fingerprint sensor normally found on iPhones.Rather than having to scan their fingerprint, iPhone X owners can unlock their phone and pay for things just by looking at the smartphone.“Nothing has ever been simpler, more natural and effortless,”Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said during the product’s launch. “Face ID is the future of how we unlock our smartphones and protect our sensitive information.”Its new front-facing camera also lets owners bring emojis to life. Just by looking at the screen, users can see a live image of themselves as a talking panda, chicken, or even poop emoji.But despite its new features, the iPhone X’s price of around 9,000 yuanisn’t winning any fans over. Set to go on sale in China at the end of October, it will be up against competition from many local brands, most of which have similar phones sold for much lower prices.According to industry analyst Jia Mo, Apple faces challenges from top domesticdevices such as Xiaomi’s Mix 2 and Huawei’s Mate 10. “There are many Chinese phones that can provide a better experience at this price range,” he told Forbes.
