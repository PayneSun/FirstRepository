Staying young forever
From the stories of ancient Greece to science fiction movies, immortality has long been something that humans have talked about.We’re often told that the secret to a longer life is down to eating a healthy diet and taking regular exercise.Yet according to a Google-owned company, the answer could lie in an unusual-lookingrodent called the naked mole rat.Calico, a company co-founded by Google in 2013, says it wants to figure out why our body ages, calling it the “most fundamental unsolved problem in biology” , by studying the strange creature, whose DNA shares an 85 percent similarity to humans’.Native to East Africa, the animal looks like a baby mouse, with pink, wrinkly skin and large teeth.It can survive for years in harsh conditions in underground tunnels, and lives for around 30 years, more than five times longer than mice.The amazing animal’s body can even create oxygen “like a plant” if it’s placed in conditions without air, and is highly resistant to cancer.So how will this help humans live longer?According to a 2014 study by researchers at the American Friends of Tel Aviv University in New York, the naked mole rat’s body contains high levels of a protein which scientists believe is what keeps it from aging.Unlike humans, as naked mole rats grow older, their bodies don’t grow weak and their brain functions don’t worsen, meaning that elderly naked mole rats are still as strong as younger ones.“There’s still a lot we can learn from extremely long-lived animals,” Rochelle Buffenstein, a professor at the University of Texas, US, wrote in a study on naked mole rats.She added that studying the animal may allow us to “evaluate whether nature – through millions of years of evolutionary experimentation – has already evolved the best way to delay the aging process.”
