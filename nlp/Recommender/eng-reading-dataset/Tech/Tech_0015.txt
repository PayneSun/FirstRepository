Taking giant leaps
It was in 1969 that an estimated 600 million people around the globe watched history’s most famous space mission.As US astronaut and NASA employee Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface of the moon, he said the iconic line, “One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind”.Since then, NASA has been responsible for many giant leaps of its own － more than most of us realize.This year marks the 60th anniversary of NASA’s founding in 1958.To most of us, NASA is simply a name that’s linked with rocket launches and trips to space.However, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is to thank for many everyday things that we don’t give much thought to.Take mobile phones for example.Most of us don’t know that NASA invented the technology behind the cameras found in modern phones.Thanks to research by NASA scientists who were looking for ways to create small cameras to fit onto spacecraft, we’re able to take selfies today.The agency’s creativity has led to the creation of many other great inventions, including the computer mouse, laptop computer, baby formula, and even sneakers.Indeed, NASA stands by its motto, “For the Benefit of All”.But while these things have brought convenience and improvements to our planet, let’s not forget NASA’s main purpose: to explore what’s outside of Earth.From the Space Shuttle Program, which sent over 300 astronauts into space between 1972 and 2011, to the James Webb Space Telescope, a new telescope that will allow us to see deeper into the universe, NASA is making greater and greater steps into understanding space as each day goes by.“NASA’s achievements write a glorious chapter in human history, one that’s nearly impossible to overstate,” wrote Tony Long on tech site Wired.As NASA’s anniversary approaches, it’s exciting to imagine what the next 60 years will bring.Will our generation witness the first human on Mars, as our parents’ generation saw the first human on the moon?We can only wait and see.
