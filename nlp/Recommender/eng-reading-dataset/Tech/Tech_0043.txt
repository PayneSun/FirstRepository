Baidu is also developing driverless cars, which can analyze traffic flow and control their *maneuvers automatically, Cao Haitao of Baidu’s artificial intelligence unit told Xinhua.Pony Ma: Internet companies should further cultivate the Chinese market.Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent, said that the Chinese market is large and deep enough for internet companies to focus on and he’s confident that Chinese companies are competitive players in the international mobile internet market.Tencent also revealed that it’s developing new products, including FACE-IT, a facial-recognition program that the company showed off during the conference.
