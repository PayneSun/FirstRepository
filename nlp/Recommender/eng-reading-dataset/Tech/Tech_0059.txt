Worried over robot war
It sounds like a science-fiction nightmare. But “killer robots” have the likes of British scientist Stephen Hawking and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak fretting and warning the machines could fuel ethnic cleansings and an arms race.Autonomous weapons, which use artificial intelligence to select targets without human intervention, have been described as “the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms,” about 1,000 tech bigwigs wrote in an open letter on July 28.Unlike drones, which require a human hand in their action, this kind of robot would have some autonomous decision-making abilities and the capacity to act on its own authority.“The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI (artificial intelligence) arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote.“If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable,” said the letter released at the opening of the 2015 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Buenos Aires.The idea of an automated killing machine – made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator – is moving swiftly from science fiction to reality, according to the scientists.“The deployment of such systems is – practically if not legally – feasible within years, not decades,” the letter said.Lower bar for entryThe development of such weapons, while potentially reducing the extent of battlefield casualties, might also lower the threshold for going to battle, noted the scientists.The scientists painted an apocalyptic scenario in which autonomous weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, dictators or warlords hoping to carry out ethnic cleansings.The group concluded with an appeal for a “ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control.”In a 2014 BBC interview, Hawking said the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.“It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded,” he said.Authorities are gradually waking up to the risk of robot wars. Last May, for the first time, the United Nations brought governments together to begin talks on so-called “lethal autonomous weapons systems” that can select targets and carry out attacks without direct human intervention.In 2012, the US government imposed a 10-year human control requirement on automated weapons.There have been examples of weapons being stopped in their infancy.After UN-backed talks, blinding laser weapons were banned in 1998, before they ever hit the battlefield.
