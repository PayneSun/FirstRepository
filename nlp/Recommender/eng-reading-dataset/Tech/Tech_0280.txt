'Net bargaining' service booms
A middleman will - for a cut of the discount they get you - bargain on your behalf for lower prices with e-retailers. They are called "net bargainers," and the service is booming amid China’s fast-growing online-shopping industry.A search for "net bargainer" on taobao.com, China’s largest online shopping website, gives 2,186 search results."I thought 120 yuan would be a fair price for a pair of shoes priced 150 yuan at an online store. But a net bargainer took half an hour to get me the shoes for 100 yuan," said Wang Huan, a 25-year-old white-collar worker.After the deal, she paid the bargaining fee - 20 percent of the 50-yuan price gap - which she thought was "absolutely worth it."According to iResearch, China’s online payments totaled 576.6 billion yuan in 2009 - doubling in value for the fifth straight year.Wang Yu, a white-collar, said it takes time and energy to compare prices on the Internet. That is why people are willing to pay for the bargaining service.Guo Wenlong, a businessman-turned "net bargainer,", who had experience selling sanitary products, said he is good at his job because he has direct contact with producers."I know the goods’ factory prices, so I have an edge in negotiation with the sellers," Guo said.Starting last October, he now earns more than 10,000 yuan per month on average.As a new occupation, there are still some questions concerning "net bargainers."Lawyer Wang Jun asked what happens when the buyer ends up with a fake product and what responsibilities bargainers have to buyers? And what if bargainers fail to cut the price?Wang said the government should start drafting regulations for the new occupation, in order to protect the rights of online customers."It is a legal vacuum. The rights of both bargainers and customers are unclear and unprotected," Wang Kaiyu, a sociologist warned.
