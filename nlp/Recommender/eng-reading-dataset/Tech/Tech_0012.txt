Chilies bring benefits
What can be both red or green, round or sharp, big or small, and more importantly, loved or hated by someone? Yes, the answer is chilies.Many of us in China enjoy adding chilies to our food, but did you know that this spicy vegetable could also be dangerous?A 34-year-old US man recently ended up in hospital after eating a Carolina Reaper, the spiciest chili in the world. After taking just a single bite of one, the man suffered from “thunderclap”headaches in the following few days, reported BBC News.In fact, reports of stomachache and headache caused by eating spicy food are not something unusual. But if chilies are harmful, why is it that human beings are the only animals to eat this vegetable? According to the website Huanqiu, about 600 million Chinese people – almost half of the national population – are chili eaters. So what makes people love chilies so much? The human body reacts to the burning sensation that comes from eating chilies by releasing endorphins, natural chemicals that “produce a sense of happiness”, noted BBC News.And the benefits go even further than just personal enjoyment. A survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, published in the British Medical Journal, found that the mortality rate of those who eat spicy food once or twice a week is 10 percent lower than those who eat it less than once a week. The number decreased to 14 percent for those who eat spicy food six to seven times a week. And another study done by the University of Vermont came to a similar conclusion. “The data encourages people to eat more spicy food to improve health and reduce mortality risk at an early age,” Liu Qi, a nutritionist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, told BBC News.Capsaicin has anti-cancer properties and the ability to increase our metabolism. So, don’t worry if you love spicy food. It seems that chilies are actually good for us – except for the Carolina Reaper, perhaps.
