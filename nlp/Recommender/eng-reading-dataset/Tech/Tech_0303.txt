Love song helps getting her heart
Music is the key to a woman’s heart, after research showed that they are more likely to give men their phone numbers if romantic songs are playing in the background.In tests by French psychologists, an "average-looking man" was challenged to get as many single women as possible to hand over their numbers and go for a drink.If his potential dates had been listening to romantic lyrics beforehand, his chances of success were doubled.For the tests, experts from the University of southern Brittany and the University of southern Paris selected 87 female volunteers aged 18 to 20.They each spent five minutes in a waiting room while one of two carefully selected tunes played in the background. They heard either a romantic ballad – Je L’aime a Mourir (I Love Her to Death) by Francis Cabrel, or L’heure du The (Time For Tea) by Vincent Delerm which was classed as neutral.Next, thinking they were taking part in a consumer survey, they were taken to a different room and asked to discuss the difference between two types of biscuit with the 20-year-old man.At the end of the discussion, he would use the same chat-up line with each one: "My name is Antoine, as you know. I think you are very nice and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number. I’ll phone you later and we can have a drink together somewhere next week."Each time after making his pitch, Antoine was instructed "to gaze and smile at the participant" while she considered her answer.Only 27.9 percent of the women who heard the neutral music agreed to Antoine’s proposal. But those who were exposed to the love song were much easier to win over – 52.2 percent of that group offered their details.The research appears to back up theory that any man making romantic overtures should be careful to when choosing music "back at his place."The scientists, who published the results in the journal Psychology of Music, believe that romantic lyrics may "prime" people’s behaviour."It was found that women previously exposed to romantic lyrics complied with the request more readily than women exposed to the neutral ones. The difference was significant. If you’re having trouble getting a date, picking the right soundtrack could improve the odds," they said.One of the researchers, Nicolas Gueguen, wrote, "The results are interesting for scientists who work on the effect of background music on individuals’ behaviour."It is not just women who fall under the spell of love songs. Previous work by the same team found that men spent more money in florists when romantic music was being played.
