Toto toilet targets health conscious
In Japan, the global leader in high-tech toilet design, the latest restroom marvel should come with a health warning for hypochondriacs - it doubles as a medical lab that can really spoil your day.The latest "intelligent" model, manufactured by market leader Toto, goes a step further: It offers its users an instant health check-up every time they answer the call of nature.Designed for the housing company Daiwa House with Japan’s growing army of elderly in mind, it provides a urine analysis, takes the user’s blood pressure and body temperature, and measures their weight using an inbuilt floor scale."With the current model, your data is sent automatically to your personal computer, and then you can e-mail it to your doctor," says Akiho Suzuki, an architect at Daiwa House.The "Intelligence Toilet" is capable of storing the data of up to five different people and retails at 350,000 to 500,000 yen (about $4,100 to $5,850) in Japan, she said.The first models were imported from the United States, where they had been used mainly in hospitals, and quickly became standard in Japan in the booming 1980s. They can now be found in at least 70 percent of Japanese homes.First-time foreign visitors to Japan are often baffled by the complexity of Japanese high-tech toilets, which feature computerized control panels, usually with Japanese language instructions as well as small pictograms.Standard functions include heated seats, temperature controls, hot-air bottom dryers and ambient background music.In recent times, Japanese toilets have also become more environmentally friendly, and most new models now use less than five liters (1.3 gallons) per flush, compared to 13 liters just a few years ago.
