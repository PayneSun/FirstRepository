Building new sustainability
Green energy is crucial if we are to build a more sustainable society. Not only are there jobs in the field, but involvement in the industry provides plenty of opportunities to be creative, to get your ideas heard and to channel student activism into a worthwhile cause.Qi Chunmei, 22, stands beside a machine used to extract and purify silicon every working day. It may not sound very glamorous, but Qi is part of a dynamic new industry that is helping to change the planet. Qi works in the new energy business. She’s a technician at the Ningxia Ningdian Photovoltaic Material Co Ltd in Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui autonomous region.The silicon product she gets from the machine will be used to make solar energy panels. These will then be installed in a solar power station located in the rural area of Ningxia.Qi, who graduated from Xi’an Jiaotong University with a bachelor’s degree in international trade, is one of many young people who have entered the new energy sector following the economic crisis.According to the National Energy Administration in July, the new energy sector is set to benefit from the creation of 150 million jobs by 2020.Employment in the new energy field is attractive to graduates, as many jobs don’t require much technical knowledge.Qi and her colleagues, who majored in a wide range of subjects including Chinese literature and civil engineering, were able to operate the machine after only one month’s training.“Most facilities are automatic so you only need to supervise the operation, and clean the panels,” said Li Wenzhang, manager of the plant.Some companies are able to find financing for new energy projects through the Clean Development Mechanism, an *initiative set out in the Kyoto Protocol in 2007. This allows a country with an *emission-reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol to implement projects in developing countries that will help cut emissions.Using the resources of the fund, a foreign country could help a Chinese company to *facilitate emission reductions in local factories.Peng Jinhua, 26, a project manager working in a consulting company in Beijing, is one of those benefiting from the initiative.“I went to western provinces to find factories with high energy consumption levels, such as cement plants,” said Peng.Then he contacted foreign countries to get funding and technology support to help the plants reduce emissions.Peng’s company makes approximately 700,000 yuan for each partnership it sets up.“You can earn a handsome income, and more importantly, both local people and foreign countries will benefit from it,” said Peng.
