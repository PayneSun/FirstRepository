China leads world in mobile payment
Most of us in China are used to paying with almost everything with our phones. But for foreign visitors who aren’t familiar with this method, it may seem strange.At least, this was the case for Lim Swee Say, Manpower Minister of Singapore, according to the country’s Prime Minister Lee HsienLoong. During Singapore’s National Day Rally on Aug 20, Lee told the audience about Lim’s first experience with Chinese payment methods.Lim was waiting in line to buy chestnutsat a street stall in Shanghai and saw other customers show their phone and take the chestnuts without giving over any cash. Soon after, he realized that the customers were using WeChat Pay, reported the Straits Times.Lee pointed out that Singapore lags behind in mobile payments. “When visitors from China find that they have to use cash here, they ask, ‘How can Singapore be so backward?’,” Lee said.The popularity of mobile payments in China has pushed several foreign companies and agencies to accept them. According to Xinhua News Agency, many countries now accept mobile payment services for Chinese tourists, with WeChat Pay covered in 13 overseas countries and regions and Alipay over 200.It’s now common to see the familiar green or blue logos in tourist destinations around the world, from a tiny shop in the Scottish Highlands to a huge department store in New York.And while mobile payments are now a normal part of life in China, the trend is also sweeping other nations. According to global firm Forrester Research, in the United States, mobile payments rose 39 percent in 2016.Still, according to the Financial Times, “Chinese mobile payments were nearly 50 times greater than those in the US last year.”This may be partly because Western mobile payment services require businesses to install expensive equipment before customers can use them. While in China, all it takes is a QR code and a smartphone, as Lim learned.
