Beware of rumor online
A micro blog with space for 140 Chinese characters had once been a source of endless amusement for Wang Ganghui, a senior majoring in biochemistry at Ji’nan University.Until last month, the 21-year-old had believed that he was part of a broader movment, one of enlightenment and open criticism. Recently, however, Wang’s micro blog is silent.The reason? It’s because of a woman known as “Zhao Meimei”. Earlier this month, Wang joined many other users to criticize the US-based student for her wealthy overseas life, because they thought her money came from corruption since her mother was a local official.But later Wang found out that the woman student was actually being supported by her father, a hard-working businessman.“I felt guilty… Someone hid part of the truth to make a conflict. The worst thing is – I did not even have a chance to apologize to her,” he says.Wang is not the only young Internet user to be confounded by an online world made up entirely of fragmented information.This year saw a phenomenal boom in micro-blogging in both private and public life.According to statistics from the International Communication Office of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee last month, the number of micro bloggers in China now exceed 300 million.For private users, a micro blog can provide real-time updates from anyone a user chooses to “follow”. These can range from family members to celebrities. Information can instantly be spread through “re-tweeting”.In the public sphere however, a micro blog can also become a link between users and the authorities.According to an annual government affairs report on micro blogs, over 20,000 governmental agencies in China launched official accounts this year, increasing 200 percent from last year.However, with the increasing popularity of micro blogs comes a number of problems.Chen Changfeng, deputy director of the School of Journalism and Communication at Tsinghua University, highlighted two major types of misbehavior that can occur on micro blogs and upset young users.“Some marketers engage in sensational promotion in an effort to generate hype for some person or product; others use the free channel to manufacture and spread fake news and rumors like a virus,” Chen says.He says that an average micro blogger receives and transmits info, but when faced with such a vast amount of information, lacks the ability to discern the difference between the real and the fake stories.As a result, rumors on micro blogs are rampant, such as the salt crisis and the alleged death of novelist Jin Yong.Having realized this, Internet users have come together to combat micro blog misconduct by forming voluntary groups such as the Rumor Clarification Association.Zhu Xun, 27 is an editor of the Squirrel Club, an organization that appeals to common sense in its attempts to discredit online rumors.“If you give a careful second thought, you’ll discover that many micro blog rumors just lack grounds,” says Zhu.He recalled a recent micro blog rumor which claimed that two students at the Wuhan Textile University had been murdered and their kidneys removed.“But a kidney for a transplant should be taken when the donor is alive, and even then, the chance of a match is only 0.001 percent,” he explained.Such groups form only one part of a broader framework of cyber-supervision. The government and individual operators of micro-blogging sites have also stepped in to monitor posted content.Last week, the State Internet Information Office revealed that 206 micro blog accounts had been shut down for dispersing pornographic information.Deputy Director, Qian Xiaoqian, said: “The government has to verify the facts and present the real story to lessen irrational fear, and penalize those who break relevant laws.”The Sina Weibo micro-blogging site has created a separate account to refute rumors. According to Chen Jinguo, a Sina senior PR manager, they’ve both filtered the illegal content and employed a team to check published posts for inaccuracies.“But it’s still the prime duty for every user to be aware of thinking and deciding whether to publish or re-tweet any info on their micro blog,” said Zhu.
