Japan firm tones down “boyfriend tracker” app
A Japanese firm that marketed a smartphone application to girlfriends and wives who wanted to keep an eye on their philandering partners has had to tone down the service after complaints that it was effectively spying on people.Tokyo-based Manuscript released on Sunday a new version of the “Kare Log” – meaning “boyfriend log” – after the original application attracted hundreds of complaints from people who discovered it had been surreptitiously installed on their phones, while software security firm McAfee identified the app as a “Potentially Unwanted Programme”.Japan’s communications ministry has even waded into the debate on privacy, saying in a statement that “The consent of a tracked individual is very important. There were problems with the way that Kare Log was advertised.”First launched on August 30, the application could be installed into a smartphone and a computer could then be used to monitor the whereabouts of the device – and, presumably, the owner, through its GPS data.The basic charge was Y525 (£4.31) a month, which provided the location of the phone and the amount of energy left in the phone’s battery. For the £15.83 “platinum plan,” however, the member would be able to access the list of all the calls that had been made from the phone, the dates, times and durations, as well as other applications that had been installed.Critically, the application did not show an icon on the screen when it was being utilised, meaning that the owner of the smartphone might not even realise that it had been installed.The initial version of the service was downloaded more than 24,000 times in 10 weeks, Yoshinori Miura, president of Manuscript, told. The new version has already been snapped up 500 times in less than 24 hours, he said.“We had around 60 complaints by email but I cannot count how many phone calls we took from people who were unhappy that it had been installed on their phones,” Miura admitted, adding that it had also been criticised in online forums.“The first version was mainly targeted at women who wanted to know where there husband was,” said Miura. “But the new version requires a password to access the information and we see it as a way in which couples can share information with each other.”The new service is described as a “location service for lovers,” the company said.
