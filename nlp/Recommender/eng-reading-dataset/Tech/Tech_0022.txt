China’s own navigator
Many years ago, people relied on the sun, moon and stars to find their way around. Later, the compass was introduced. And now, we have satellite navigation (satnav) systems to guide us.A satnav system uses groups of satellites to show the user’s location. They send information to a receiver, such as a smartphone, to show us where we are.The earliest built satnav system is the Global Positioning System (GPS), which belongs to the US. Then there is Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), the European Union’s Galileo and China’s own satellite navigation system, BeiDou.On Oct 14, an ARJ21-700 plane, which was the first domestically-produced (国产的) jet to be equipped with the BeiDou navigation system, successfully completed a test flight.The results showed the performance of the system developed by China matches that of similar systems produced abroad, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.Since its introduction in 2000, the BeiDou navigation system has seen increasing numbers of applications linked to everyday life, from shared bikes to farming.When it comes to shared bikes, smart locks that support BeiDou chips offer more accurate positioning than others, making it easier to find a bike.Farmers can use BeiDou-enabled tractors to plow (犁耕) the soil, and drones (无人机) using BeiDou to sow seeds, which can boost (提高) efficiency and make better use of resources. BeiDou’s farming applications have spread from Heilongjiang province to Beijing, Liaoning, Shanxi, Hubei and other regions across China.With its many uses, the BeiDou navigation system is even playing a big role in the Belt and Road Initiative. “To date, the Beidousystem has covered most parts of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,” said Yang Changfeng, chief designer of the BeiDou system.Today, there are more than 20 BeiDou satellites above our heads, and China plans to launch up to eight more this year to expand the BeiDou network to better serve the Belt and Road Initiative.“As BeiDou expands its overseas reach, it will be increasingly popular in the logistics (物流) industry,” said Miao Qianjun, secretary-general of the navigation services association.“Ships, for instance, can use it to position themselves while sailing across oceans to European countries, no longer limited to Southeast Asian regions.”
