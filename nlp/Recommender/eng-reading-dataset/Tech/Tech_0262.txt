Unseemly campus cultures revealed
Prison-like managementDespite college students’ increasing awareness of freedom, all schools still apply old-style management. Therefore, freedom-seeking students escape from the strictly managed dorms to rent apartments in nearby communities. To avoid off-campus problems, universities should consider relaxing the rules.Foul mouthsObscenities are oral pollution. The filthy words turn the campus environment from a peaceful well-educated one into squalid neighborhood of rude residents.Public displays of affectionCollege students often canoodle wherever they are, while never thinking of others who view such intimate behaviors with embarrassment.Conspicuous consumptionMany students are hip to the latest trends, chasing after fashion and famous brands as if the family money was for nothing else. Nodding outProfessors literally put students to sleep with their boring lectures and old-fashioned teaching methods.Easy to skip classWith the expansion of college enrollments, many classrooms are overcrowded, making it difficult for teachers monitor class attendance and easy for students to skip class.Too much cleavageIt’s almost impossible to find virtuous coed on campus. Some young women dress suggestively and, if they are seen on the street, might be mistaken as nightclub hostesses.Sluggish guysMany male students spend all day doing anything but studying, pursuing activities that leave them listless. Their life styles are bad for both their physical and mental health.
