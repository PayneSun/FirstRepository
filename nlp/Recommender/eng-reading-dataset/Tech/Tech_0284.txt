Why not brushing your teeth can kill you
Now a Bristol University dental scientist has discovered that a common bacteria responsible for tooth decay and gum disease can break out into the bloodstream and help blood clots to form.In turn these can cause heart attacks and strokes, which together cause more than 200,000 deaths in Britain every year.There the bacteria use a protein on their surface, called PadA, to force blood platelets to bind together to shelter them.Describing the mechanism, he said: "When the platelets clump together they completely encase the bacteria. This provides a protective cover not only from the immune system, but also from antibiotics that might be used to treat infection."In addition, platelet clumping can cause small blood clots, growths on the heart valves or inflammation of blood vessels that can block the blood supply to the heart and brain.""People need to be aware that as well keeping a check on their diet, blood pressure, cholesterol and fitness levels, they also need to maintain good dental hygiene to minimise their risk of heart problems," said the scientist.But the research should also speed up the development of drugs which could prevent potentially deadly blood clots from forming in the first place.Prof Jenkinson described the discovery of the key protein as a "new tool" on which to test drugs which might stop it from clotting blood.He is working with his colleagues to see how the proteinâ€™s platelet-causing function can be blocked."This could eventually lead to new treatments for cardiovascular disease which is the biggest killer in the developed world," said Prof Jenkinson.
