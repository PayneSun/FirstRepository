Ocean of diamonds
Over the years, countless poets and songwriters have described the night sky as looking as if it were full of diamonds. As it turns out, there could be some truth in that.On Earth, natural diamonds are formed when carbon-containing minerals are mixed with high pressure and heat over billions of years.Within the faraway icy planets of Neptune and Uranus, however, it’s believed that diamonds are formed in a more interesting way.The planets, which are both around four times bigger than Earth, are each covered by an ocean made up of water and hydrocarbons.It’s believed that the huge pressure and high temperatures within the planets lead to diamonds being created from the ocean’s hydrocarbons. These diamonds then “rain” down to the center of the planets.But while this has always just been a theory, a team of researchers recently decided to try it out for themselves.According to a study published in the science journal Nature Astronomy in August, the scientists attempted to create “diamond rain” by firing lasers at polystyrene, a common plastic material that’s very much like the hydrocarbons on the two planets.Using special equipment, the researchers managed to create conditions like those on Neptune and Uranus. They used two kinds of lasers, creating a similar temperature and pressure to those found around 10,000 kilometers inside the planets.Following their brief experiment, the team discovered that they had created diamonds successfully, although they were only a few nanometers in diameter.However, Dominik Kraus, co-author of the study, believes that deep within Neptune and Uranus, the diamonds would be a lot bigger. According to Kraus, they could also be the reason why the inner layers of the ice giants are so hot.“These diamonds will sink down … and when they sink down, there will be friction with the surrounding area … and all this generates heat,” he wrote in the study.It’s hoped that the findings could eventually lead to easier and cheaper ways of creating artificial diamonds, which are used in everything from jewellery to machinery.But until scientists discover how to truly fill the sky with diamonds, we’ll just have to stick with songs and poetry.
