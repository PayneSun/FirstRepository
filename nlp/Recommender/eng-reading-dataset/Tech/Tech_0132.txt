Tablet market on fire
The past week was possibly the most eventful in the history of customer technology markets, or to be precise, the 7-inch (17.8-cm) tablet market. Never before have three of the biggest players in the industry scheduled what could be truly historic product launches so close together.Not only did Apple officially join the blossoming market by releasing the iPad Mini on Oct 23, but Microsoft launched its Surface tablet on Oct 26, and Google, despite having to cancel events due to hurricane Sandy, annouced its latest Nexus 10 tablet in New York on Oct 29, only two months after the release of its Nexus 7.Who do you think will top the small tablet market? Let’s run a quick comparison to find out.Apple’s iPad MiniRelease date: Nov 2 (Wi-Fi version)Operating system: iOS 6Size: 19.9 x 13.5 x 0.7 cmPrices: $329 (16GB Wi-Fi), $429 (32GB Wi-Fi), $519 (64GB Wi-Fi), or $459 (16GB Data), $559 (32GB Data), $659 (64GB Data)Despite its name, the 7.9-inch iPad Mini is one of the largest among the mini-tablets. It’s got all the aesthetics of its original 9.7-inch counterpart and is incredibly thin–just 7.2 mm, 23 percent thinner than the iPad. But it falls short of other tablets due to its non-Retina 1024×768 display.The iPad Mini comes in different models–16GB, 32GB, and 64GB–so onboard storage shouldn’t be an issue. The base price, however, is significantly higher than the competition, and the 1024x768 display resolution pales in comparison to the Nook HD’s 1440x900 or the 1280x800 of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD.Google’s Nexus 10Release date: Nov 13Operating system: Android 4.2 Jelly BeanSize: 26.4 x 17.8 x 0.9 cmPrices: $399 (16GB), $449 (32GB)Google may have been forced to cancel its Android event in New York City on Oct 29 due to the threat of hurricane Sandy, but that isn’t stopping it from making same big announcements.Google has officially revealed the Samsung-made Nexus 10 tablet, and it seems like most of the rumors were true.For starters, Google has confirmed that the Nexus 10 will be running Android 4.2 out of the box, so get excited. It will also come equipped with a 10-inch display running at an impressive 2560x1600 resolution. On the inside, it’ll have a A15 dual-core processor running alongside 2GB of RAM, so expect the Nexus10 to be a speedy little tablet.Microsoft’s SurfaceRelease date: Oct 26Operating system: Windows 8 RTSize: 27.5 x 17.2 x 0.9 cmPrices: $499 (32GB Wi-Fi)Surface is being launched alongside Windows 8, Microsoft’s overdue operating system, which is being described as the biggest change in the history of Windows.It is a bold product with some great touches, like the magnetic cover that turns into a keyboard, and a minimal, Apple-like design. It doesn’t feature a camera and focuses on Office software, which suggests Microsoft is pitching this gadget as an executive toy. There’s no 3G connection (only Wi-Fi) so owners won’t have to worry about an extra contract.The real delight, however, is Metro, the impressive navigation interface. It is beautifully designed with a zingy typography and brightly colored squares for navigation. Pre-orders for Surface in the US sold out over the weekend, so it would seem customers are excited.
