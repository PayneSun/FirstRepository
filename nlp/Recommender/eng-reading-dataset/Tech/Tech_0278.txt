Older men stay attractive
The modern man is capable of turning a woman’s head up to the age of 55, while 30 years ago few women would have looked twice at a man over 45, the research showed.A greater emphasis on dressing well and keeping fit has dramatically improved the physical attractiveness of older men, according to the findings.The trend towards women marrying and having children later in life has also extended the period for which a bachelor is considered eligible.Debenhams, a famous department store in Britain, surveyed 1,000 women and 1,000 men aged between 18 and 60 on their attitudes to male appearance.Baldness is no longer seen as a stigma, and even a slight paunch is unlikely to render a man unattractive to women, the study for Debenhams found.Many women reported finding the greater financial security of older men reassuring because it represents a better life for their children.Ruth Attridge, a spokeswoman for the department store, said: "Older men are now remaining more attractive to women for longer than ever before."They are increasingly seen as eligible, prospective partners rather than old bores with little energy left to catch the female eye."It’s great news for George Clooney and Brad Pitt." Men are now spending more time, either alone or with a partner, selecting styles to suit their shape, as well as choosing shades which complement their complexion, hair and eye colour.Miss Attridge continued: "Few older men now walk into a store and bulk-buy the first item they see. They understand that continuing to look good after fifty means putting much more effort into dressing well for every occasion.“Younger men, by comparison, still feel that they don’t really have to try that hard.”
