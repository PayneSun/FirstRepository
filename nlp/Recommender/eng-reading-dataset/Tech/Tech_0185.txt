Creative start-up cash idea
Many of us may dream of owning a small but tasteful bookstore, café, or a flower shop around the corner. But where do you get the money for it?Wen Erniu (her Internet user name), 28, was not held back by the problem. She solved it creatively by getting together with like-minded people.Wen, a sociology graduate, worked as a civil servant at a governmental training institute in Beijing for three years.“Sitting in front of my computer in the office, I always fancied holding a cup of coffee and enjoying the sunshine. Then I had the idea of launching a café of my own,” said Wen.She did not have enough money, and did not want to quit her stable job for a risky startup.So she posted on douban.com to invite people to raise funds for a café last yearUnexpectedly, she attracted 79 partners from the Internet, and 410,000 yuan in total to start the project.They worked on plans such as corporate charters and operational guidelines and signed agreements on how to manage the café.The cafe named “Many People’s Cafe” opened in Beijing last September.As 80 people jointly own the 190-square-meter store, disagreements over management were inevitable.Arguments flared up over how to decorate the café. Some wanted a rock music theme, others insisted on a rustic look. That was only the beginning.“We are wading across the stream by feeling our way,” said Wen.None of the 80 shareholders has any professional management experience. At the beginning, there were only four waiters in the café and no manager.“We found it was not good, so now every three months we elect a manager from shareholders and take turns to manage the café,” said Wen.Although this group of young people are proud to run the café on the basis of mutual trust, respect and democracy, the lack of experience and systematic management adds uncertainty to its future.Currently, the running cost of the café is 35,000 yuan a month, while the turnover is merely 24,000 yuan, although they have launched a series of activities to attract customers.Their model has inspired young people around the country. A café named March was launched by 80 shareholders with 300,000 yuan as capital in Wuhan last week.“Earning money is not our only goal. Many shareholders joined to make friends, or to have an interesting experience,” said Wen.
