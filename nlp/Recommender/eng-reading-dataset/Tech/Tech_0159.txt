Time to grab a bargain
Crouching on the sidewalk of Capital Normal University, Jiang Dongxin, in flip-flops, is bargaining with another student over a secondhand textbook. Around the 22-year-old economics major, 30 graduating students and more bargain hunters make the square in front of the library look like a flea market.On the verge of graduation, secondhand trading is booming once again. In an era in which online shopping is gaining momentum among students, graduation sales are seeing a shift from traditional street sales to cyberspace.“The leftovers from my online sale are all here on this blanket,” said Jiang. He says many of his classmates take advantage of online shopping for good deals.Yu Yingying, a senior at Huazhong University of Science and Techonology, finds she can earn more from selling secondhand books online than on campus.“On Taobao, I sold a classic English novel for 30 yuan while the price of the same book is bargained down to 10 yuan on campus,” said the 23-year-old.She said trading face to face with students from the same school or even the same department makes the sale more like a charity.“Campus sales are really cheap, because you cannot act like a greedy businesswoman when dealing with fellow students,” said Yu. However, the “charity” nature of student flea market is the reason why it is so attractive to many, including non-students, according to Li Jiyi, a data analyst in the neighborhood of Beijing University of Technology.For two years, Li has gone to campus flea markets to pick up novels, especially English ones.“The price is over 50 percent cheaper than the market price,” said Li. Unlike online vendors who are more practical, “students don’t make money, they just get rid of things.”However, “Choice on campus is very limited,” said Xiamen University’s Qian Feng. “When you go online, you can find anything available from people all over the country,” said Qian.The 20-year-old sophomore aims at seasonal flea market for secondhand textbooks for his study major, but isn’t always lucky enough to find the right ones.Now online, typing the name, he can find the book from another province and have it delivered it to his door.
