NASA finds second Earth
NASA posted on their website today (July 24) that astronomers find another habitable planet like ours.Today John Grunsfeld, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, said: "On the 20th anniversary year of the discovery that proved other suns host planets, the Kepler exoplanet explorer has discovered a planet and star which most closely resemble the Earth and our Sun.“This exciting result brings us one step closer to finding an Earth 2."The newly discovered plant called "Kepler-452b" is the smallest planet to date discovered orbiting in the habitable zone - the area around a star where liquid water could pool on the surface of an orbiting planet - of a G2-type star, like our sun.John Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, told the conference: "It has spent six billion years in the habitable zone - longer than the age of Earth - and a considerable time for life to arise somewhere on the earth or in the ocean.The Kepler Mission has found around 4,500 exo-planets, although no others as similar to Earth as 452-b, but Mr Jenkins said there were still 50 per cent of planets we cannot yet see.Mr Jenkins added: "We can think of Kepler-452b as an older, bigger cousin to Earth, providing an opportunity to understand and reflect upon Earth’s evolving environment."It’s awe-inspiring to consider that this planet has spent six billion years in the habitable zone of its star; longer than Earth. That’s substantial opportunity for life to arise, should all the necessary ingredients and conditions for life exist on this planet.”
