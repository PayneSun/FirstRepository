Waste in space
Going to the toilet is easy down here on Earth, because gravity pulls your solid and liquid wastes down, away from you. But in the gravity-free environment of space, waste tends to just float around.Since the early days of the spaceflight, NASA has learned a lot about what to do with human waste while their astronauts are away from Mother Earth. The very first "space toilet" was not that comfortable. Alan Shepard, the first American to be put into space, had to pee inside his spacesuit just before the flight on May 5, 1961.Now, space toilets look similar to the Western style toilets that people use on Earth. However, instead of flushing, they work like a vacuum cleaner sucking away the astronaut’s waste.When nature calls, astronauts fasten their bodies to the toilet so that they won’t float away. They are held on by a bar across their thighs.While the toilet is in use, it has a continuous flow of air blowing in through holes under the seat. This airflow pushes waste toward the bottom of the toilet, drawing it into a bag, holding solid waste, but letting the air through.The urinal works for both men and women. It’s a flexible hose with a funnel. It can be used whether you are sitting on the toilet or standing. The hose then travels to the waste water tank.There are different ways of treating solid and liquid waste. All solid waste is brought back to Earth for treatment, while liquid waste is thrown out into space from time to time. One astronaut had commented: "There is nothing as beautiful as a urine dump at sunset."
