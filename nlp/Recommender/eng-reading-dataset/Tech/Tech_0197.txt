Focus on China’s 2011
1 Party’s anniversaryThe year of 2011 celebrated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC).On July 1, Party General Secretary Hu Jintao delivered a formal speech at a rally to mark the special occasion. He summarized the Chinese people’s achievements of the past 90 years, under the leadership of the CPC.The catchphrase of the speech was the word “people”, which was repeated 136 times. This highlighted the principle of “putting people first”.“We will never forget that the people are the real heroes,” he said. He urged all Party members to “maintain close ties with the people”, and warned that alienation from the people posed the greatest risk to the Party.Hu also stated that more talented young members will be recruited into the Party. He stressed that talent is the most important resource and a strategic resource for a country’s development. “They (young members) represent the future and hope of the Party,” he said.2．South China Sea disputesTerritorial disputes between China and some of its neighbors over the South China Sea have intensified in the past few months.In July 2011, relevant parties reached an agreement on the guidelines of implementation of the DOC (The Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea), vowing to cooperate in maritime protection, search and rescue, as well as transnational crime busting.But in November, the US and the Philippines signed a declaration calling for multilateral talks to resolve maritime territorial disputes.On several occasions in 2011, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao re-affirmed China’s commitment to peaceful resolutions of the various disputes.
