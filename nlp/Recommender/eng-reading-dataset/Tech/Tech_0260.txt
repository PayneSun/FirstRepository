Sheldon has geek chic
After winning this year’s Emmy for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, Jim Parsons, 37, who plays the role of Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory, is showing no sign of slowing down.The high ratings of the show’s fourth season have proved that Cooper, the biggest geek on television, has still got it.Sheldon isn’t called a “geek” for no reason–he might have all the traits you would hate in a person: he’s highly intellectual (and he’s not humble with it); he’s cynical; he is strictly obsessive; and then there’s his apparent lack of humor.But interestingly, it is exactly those characteristics which deliver the character’s unique humor that makes millions love him.“Sheldon is an outcast, on some level,” Bill Prady, one of the creators of the show, told Entertainment Weekly last month. “But he’s honest and happy with who he is. That essentially gets people’s love.”Prady and the other writers made it an early goal to write the character as a real person, so as to “make him relatable”.And many fans cite the fact that they see plenty of similarities with their own friends – and even themselves.“The Sheldon character is a riot,” said Tom Wakeley, 21, a junior student of Engineering at the University of Texas. “He is so inflexible and smug. He reminds me of some people that I met in college.”Zhu Wenbin, 22, a junior English major at Tsinghua University, has been a fan of the series since the beginning.“Sheldon represents many of the *quirks and annoyances that we end up having but not always verbalizing,” Zhu said. “Just like Sheldon, we all have a ‘favorite sitting spot’ on the couch.”So, the awkwardness and eccentricity don’t look too bad, after all. “In a way, he’s either frank or obtuse,” Parsons, who plays Sheldon, told Los Angeles Times.For example, Sheldon says things all the time that could hurt someone’s feelings. According to Parsons, it does not show him as a bad person.“He just says it, without pretending to be someone else. I think that’s a good lesson he teaches us,” Parson said.
