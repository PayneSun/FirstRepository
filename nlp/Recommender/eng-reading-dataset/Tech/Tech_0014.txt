Rhino almost extinct
There are more than seven billion people on Earth, so it’s hard to imagine only having one other of your kind to keep you company. But sadly, for the white rhino, the world recently became a very lonely place.According to BBC News, the world’s last surviving male northern white rhino, named Sudan, died in Kenya at the age of 45 on March 19. His death means there are only two females – his daughter and granddaughter – remaining in the world, marking the extinction of a rare species.“His death is a cruel symbol of human disregard for nature and it saddened everyone who knew him,” Jan Stejskal, director of international projects at Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic, where Sudan lived before coming to Kenya, told Daily Mail.Sudan’s death brought attention to what the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit conservation organization in the US, called the “sixth mass extinction of plants and animals” on our planet.BBC News reported that by 2050, 30 to 50 percent of all the world’s species could be heading toward extinction. “It is human activity that speeds up the rate of extinction by up to 10,000 times its natural rate,” it wrote.For example, as the World Wildlife Fund noted, the population of northern white rhinos in Africa was largely wiped out during the poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. And by turning forests, grasslands and rivers into roads, buildings and reservoirs, humans further deprived these animals of their natural home.But with so many other wildlife species on Earth, why is the white rhino so important? The answer is down to biodiversity.According to National Geographic, “all species are interconnected. They depend on one another. With less biodiversity, these connections weaken and sometimes break, harming all the species in the ecosystem.”Fortunately, efforts are being made to save the white rhino. As BBC News noted, hope for protecting the species now lies in “developing in vitro fertilization techniques”.Before Sudan died, some of his genetic material was taken and safely stored.The plan is to use stored sperm from Sudan and other northern white rhino males, and eggs from the remaining females, to implant an embryo in a surrogate southern white rhino, explained BBC News.The final goal is to create a herd of five to 15 northern white rhinos that would be returned to their natural habitat in Africa, although that could take years to achieve.
