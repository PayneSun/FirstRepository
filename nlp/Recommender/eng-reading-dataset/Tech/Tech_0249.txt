China's new media in 2010
INTERNET GHOSTWRITERS"The Internet Ghostwriters," or "Wang Luo Shui Jun" in Chinese, refers to people who write threads with particular content or ideas at the request of public relationship groups in order to influence more people with their agenda.These practices often result in privacy violations or damaged reputations on the Internet.China’s Tort Liability Law, which took effect in July last year, stipulates that in cases of privacy violations or damaged reputations, the victim has the right to inform the Internet service provider (ISP) to delete harmful postings and that the ISP must face joint liability for damages if it fails to act.Experts have urged the supervision to focus on those public relationship companies or sellers who employ online ghostwriters, and thus stop the problem at its source.TEAM-BUYINGChina’s group purchasing websites experienced rapid development in 2010 when Wang Xing, founder of twitter-like "fanfou.com," established meituan.com, the mainland’s first group purchasing website.The potentially lucrative business model of online team-buying websites are also taking in more revenues, as shown by the number of such websites, which more than doubled to about 900 in July, according to figures from a Beijing-based Internet analysis firm, Analysys International.Despite the large number of existing competitors, most of them being small- and medium-sized firms in the market, three of China’s four major portal websites launched their own online team-buying services in July.While online team-buying will likely attract many more Chinese netizens, insiders also warn that, as a new consumption channel, team-buying lacks the supervision of laws and regulations, and customers should be cautious.SOCIAL NETWORKINGIn the latter half of 2010, China’s social networking websites entered a downturn with many small-size sites being closed. Even the leading kaixin001.com had to accept the fact of its decreasing daily visits.The embarrassing fact came to light in a situation where a number of Chinese netizens did not grasp the essence of social networking, but only indulged themselves in games, such as stealing vegetables from friends’ farms.Also, many users in social networking sites were said to be only interested in other people’s private information, while being reluctant to share their own information.Networking itself is not the goal. What these websites should do is to create their own innovative products that can help netizens achieve more value through networking, media experts warned.
