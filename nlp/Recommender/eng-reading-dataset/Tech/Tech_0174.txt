They also ranked the jobs with the most stress. Not surprisingly, none of the most stressful jobs show up on the best jobs list.At the top is software engineer and at the bottom is the lumberjack. Felling trees failed to skate above the bottom 10 percent in all ranking categories, excluding income. ”Unemployment for lumberjacks is very high, and the demand for their services is expected to continue to fall through 2016. And while working outside all day may seem like a great job perk, being a lumberjack not only is considered the worst job, but also one of the world’s most dangerous,” according to Careercast.com.And, for that most dangerous job, expect to earn a little more than $32,000 a year. That’s about $56,000 less than the cushy job of a software engineer, which has the average salary at $88,000 a year, according to Careercast.Here’s a complete look at the best and worst jobs.
