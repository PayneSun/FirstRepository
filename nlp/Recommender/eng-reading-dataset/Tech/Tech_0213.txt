World’s most expensive campervan up for sale
The world’s most expensive motorhome is up for sale - with a price tag of £1.9million.Austrian company Marchi Mobile is behind the 40ft long palace on wheels, called the eleMMent palazzo, which comes complete with a pop-up roof terrace measuring 215 sq ft, underfloor heating and a bar.The space-age vehicle has a huge master bedroom with 40-inch TV, an en suite bathroom, separate toilet, lounge and driver’s cab complete with bunk bed.The EleMMent can be fitted with mobile internet, a working fireplace, streaming video surveillance and satellite TV, and boasts a glow-in-the-dark finish to improve night safety.But the most impressive touch is the machine’s “sky lounge” which opens at the touch of a button and features underfloor heating and a bar.Marchi Mobile says the 510bhp engine will give the 20 tonne eleMMent palazzo a top speed of 93mph while being capable of a relatively high 13mpg, its efficiency for such a heavy vehicle partly down to its aerodynamic design.It will set the buyer back £1.9million and boast an area which expands to 430 sq ft, making it twice as expensive per square foot as the most lavish properties in London’s exclusive Hampstead postcode.That’s just the starting price.
