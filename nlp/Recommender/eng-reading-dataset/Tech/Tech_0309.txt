Men do tell more lies than women
It is something that wives and girlfriends have long suspected to be true.Men are far more likely to tell lies than women, researchers have revealed.Their study found that the average male tells 1,092 lies every year - roughly three a day.By contrast, the average woman will lie 728 times a year - around twice a day.And while men said their lies were most likely to relate to their drinking habits, the most popular female fib - ’Nothing’s wrong, I’m fine’ - hides their true feelings.Men are also less likely to feel guilty about lying.While 82 per cent of females questioned said telling a lie ate away at their conscience, only 70 per cent of men confessed to pangs of guilt.The jury is still out as to whether human quirks like lying are the result of genes, evolution or upbringing.According to the findings, we are most likely to spin a yarn to our mothers, with 25 per cent of men and 20 per cent of women admitting to this.By comparison, only 10 per cent said they were likely to deceive their partners.The study showed almost a fifth of us believe lie detection is acceptable in everyday life, with more than one in ten saying it was OK in the workplace.Meanwhile, three-quarters felt it was ’fine’ to use the process in criminal cases.Top 5 Fibs Told By Men1.I didn’t have that much to drink.2.Nothing’s wrong, I’m fine.3.
