Wear your death date on wrist
First there was a website that predicted when your parents would die; now there’s a watch that not only predicts when you will die, it also begins counting down.Users fill out a questionnaire about their medical history before subtracting their age from the overall results to get their death score. This score is entered into the Tikker and the countdown begins.Dubbed the ’death watch’, Tikker has been created by Swedish inventor Fredrik Colting but far from being morbid, Colting calls it ’The Happiness Watch’ and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left.’Imagine someone told you that you only had one year left to live. How would that change your life? For all of us life comes with a best-before date,’ said Colting.’While death is non-negotiable, life isn’t. All we have to do is learn how to cherish the time and the life that we have been given; seize the day and follow our hearts.’Colting came up with the idea when his grandfather passed away. To set up Tikker, the wearer fills out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history.They are also asked whether they drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer, diabetes and other diseases in their family.Wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do, as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score.Their age is then deducted from the results to predict a death date, and the Tikker begins the countdown.
