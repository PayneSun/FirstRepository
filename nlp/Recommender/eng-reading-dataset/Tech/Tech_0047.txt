Titan telescope launched
The world’s largest radio telescope was unveiled on Sept 25 in Guizhou province, reported Xinhua News Agency.The facility, named Five-hundred-meter *Aperture *Spherical Telescope (FAST), was proposed 17 years ago by Chinese astronomers. Work began on the installation in 2011.FAST is a single-aperture telescope the size of 30 soccer fields, according to China Daily. It will search for gravitational waves, detect radio emissions from stars and galaxies, and listen for signs of intelligent *extraterrestrial life, scientists said.“The ultimate goal of FAST is to discover the laws of the development of the universe,” Qian Lei told China Daily. Qian is an associate researcher with the National Astronomical Observation, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which built the telescope.“In theory, if there is civilization in outer space, the radio signal it sends will be similar to the signal we can receive when a radiation beam from a pulsar (spinning *neutron star) is approaching us,” Qian added.Zhang Shuxin, deputy general manager of the project, said foreign scientists will be invited to conduct their own space research at FAST once debugging is complete. The *colossal facility isn’t currently fully operational, with *calibration said to take up to three years before it reaches its full potential.“(The telescope) will certainly generate enthusiasm, bring people into science, and make China important in the world of science,” Joseph Taylor, a Nobel Prize-winning astronomer at Princeton University, told Xinhua.Taylor expects FAST to be a “productive” project, even if he is unsure whether any of its discoveries will lead to a Nobel Prize.But, FAST has already had a good start. In a recent trial observation, it received a set of high-quality electromagnetic waves sent from a *pulsar about 1,351 light-years away, Qian told Xinhua.The telescope’s leading engineer Wang Qiming said the telescope is expected to remain the global leader for the next 10 to 20 years.
