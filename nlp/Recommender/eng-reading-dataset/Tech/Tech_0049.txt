Lab launch blasts off
China launched its second space laboratory, the Tiangong II, on Sept 15, which space officials say will become the country’s largest scientific platform in space to date.The space lab was lifted off atop a Long March 2F carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu province at 10:04 pm.Around 20 minutes later, the mission was declared a success.Tiangong II will undergo preparations in space for about one month before the Shenzhou XI manned spacecraft, in a flight scheduled for mid-October, will rocket two astronauts to the lab. The pair will make it their home for 30 days before being returned to Earth.The lab’s predecessor, Tiangong I, was launched in September 2011 and was used mainly to test technology involved in space *docking.By comparison, the Tiangong II will be used to conduct more than 40 scientific and technological experiments together with the Shenzhou XI. That’s many times more than those carried out by the Tiangong I and the three previous Shenzhou spacecraft, according to Wu Ping, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency. China’s manned space program has entered a “new phase of application and development,” he said.
