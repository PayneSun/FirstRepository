Cui Qingtao, 17, was mixing mortar at a construction site with his parents on Sunday when he received his admission letter from Peking University, which is regarded as the best university in China.On this year’s gaokao, or China’s college entrance examination, the young man from a low-income family scored 669 points and applied to Peking University, where he was accepted as a student in the School of Journalism and Communication.Cui’s home is in a small village in the city of Qujing in Southwest China’s Yunnan province. He is the family’s oldest son, with a younger brother in high school and a sister in the fourth grade.Cui is an obedient and thoughtful son. To help his family earn more money, he’d spend his school breaks getting up at 3 o’clock in the morning to fertilize and water plants in the family’s greenhouses with his brother.On Sunday, Cui’s family was doing construction work at the site of a new home when Cui Qingtao saw a postal van come onto the property. Cui and his parents and sister were excited as they finally received the long-expected admission letter.Cui Qingtao made his parents, neither of whom went to university, very proud. When his mother read the admission letter to his father, who cannot read, a big smile broke out on his father’s face."You reap what you sow. Now I’m leaving my home village for college, but I’ll return and someday change the poor conditions of our village," Cui said."His starting point is different from other students, but I hope his future will be bright," one internet user said on Chinese social media site Weibo.
