Solving problem of shared bikes
Although Scarlet Sun, a Beijing white-collar worker, was already a user of China’s top two bike-sharing firms Ofo and Mobike, she still tried a third provider, Bluegogo, by paying a deposit of 199 yuan.It was because she badly needed a ride and Bluegogo was the only choice available at that moment. But when she applied to get the deposit back later, there was no response, reported the South China Morning Post.Sun’s experience was shared by many other users of Bluegogo, China’s third-largest dockless bike-sharing startup, as it stopped operation in November.Founded late last year, Bluegogo operated in a number of cities, such as Beijing, Shenzhen, and Chengdu. At its peak, it claimed about 700,000 bikes and 20 million users, reported Fortune.This was the latest example of Chinese bike-sharing companies closing down. The industry witnessed its first casualty in June, when Wukong Bike went out of business after just six months of operation. This was followed by several other bike-sharing companies such as 3vBike, Ding Ding and CoolQi.A major factor that caused many bike-sharing companies to close down, including Bluegogo, was that they had run out of financial support, reported the South China Morning Post.These recent events have caused concern about the safety of deposits. According to a report published by the China Internet Network Information Center in August, users may have paid a total of up to 10 billion yuan in deposits for using shared bikes.In response to the case, Wei Xi, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property, suggested that users contact the hotline and official WeChat account of the company to apply for a refund of the deposit. If it doesn’t work, they can complain to the local authority where the company was registered.“Users should choose the bike-sharing companies that have a good reputation and huge financial support,” Wei told Tencent news.Meanwhile, users don’t always have to pay a deposit to use shared bikes. For example, users with a sesame credit score of 650 and above don’t have to pay Ofo’s deposit of 199 yuan.Currently, the National Internet Finance Association of China is working with other agencies to jointly  launch a personal credit information platform, which could in return boost the completion of a unified social credit system.“If the system can be completed, the time of free deposit will come, bring benefits for both the users and companies,” commented People’s Daily.
