China’s influence worldwide
When 4-year-old British royal family member Prince George started his first day of school in September, Chinese language was on his curriculum.And he wasn’t alone. According to a report published by the British Council in September, about 51 percent of UK parents want their children to learn Chinese, as it’s believed to be one of the most useful languages to know.In fact, the popularity of Chinese drove the UK government to launch the Mandarin Excellence Programme in September last year. Its aim is to make at least 5,000 British state secondary school students fluent in Chinese by 2020.Yet, the UK isn’t the only country showing a growing interest in Chinese.The language has become the second most spoken foreign language in the United States this year, after only Spanish, with over 2.1 million speakers, according to a survey by 24/7 Wall St, a US financial news website.Many US celebrities such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Malia Obama, former US president Barack Obama’s daughter, study Chinese as a second language.In April, Arabella and Joseph Kushner, grandchildren of US President Donald Trump, performed the traditional folk song Jasmine in Mandarin for Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders met in Florida.So far, 67 countries and regions have included Chinese in their national curriculum, reported the Chinanews website.So why are so many countries enthusiastic about learning Chinese?One reason could be that as China continues to develop rapidly, Chinese is increasingly becoming a useful tool for people’s personal and professional growth.“I think everyone believes that China will be the next great superpower ... even if it’s not a superpower like America. It’s still very significant,” Aisling McCaffrey from Canada, who studied at the Renmin University of China, told Xinhua News Agency. “And learning Chinese is the best way to make sure that you can be part of that growth.”This opinion was shared by former prime minister of the UK David Cameron, who urged British students to learn Chinese to “seal tomorrow’s business deals” in 2013. As he quoted from former South Africa president Nelson Mandela, “if you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.”
