People moving on from classic snack
They were once one of the most popular foods in China. Whether they were inside our cabinets at home or the luggage we travel with, instant noodles weren’t too difficult to find. However, they seem to have fallen out of favor with Chinese people.According to statistics released by the World Instant Noodles Association in November, sales of instant noodles in China fell by nearly 10 billion packages from 2011 to 2016.In 2011, 48.38 billion were sold. This means that on average, every one of the 1.3 billion people in China consumed three packages of instant noodles a month that year, reported China Daily.The change could be attributed to the fact that instant noodles have failed to adapt to the changing taste of Chinese consumers, especially young people, who are the largest group of consumer of instant noodles, according to Beijing Youth Daily.“It’s been 10 years, but the taste of instant noodles is still the same. I just got fed up with them and no longer eat instant noodles,” a man surnamed Hu, who works for an internet company, told Beijing Youth Daily. He said that he had eaten a lot of instant noodles during his four-year college life.Another reason could be the online meal ordering industry, which has greatly enlarged young people’s choices beyond instant noodles, according to China Daily.Almost 90 percent of students at Yangzhou University in Jiangsu province said they order online meals, often on a weekly basis, reported CGTN. And according to a survey by China Youth Daily in 2016, about 70 percent of young people order online meals at least once a week.Online meal ordering services featuring convenience, quickness and different choices are replacing the competitiveness of instant noodles, Wang Yaohong, former vice-CEO of Baidu Waimai, told China Daily.The rise of online meal ordering services shows that people have a higher demand for life quality and attach more importance to health and nutrition, according to Shen Hongbing, a professor from Chongqing Technology and Business University.“Instant noodles won’t disappear, although the market share will shrink,” Shen told Chongqing Morning Post. “They will still be one of the foods familiar to many Chinese.”
