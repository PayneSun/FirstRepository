China cashing in on Cup fever
Even without sending a team to Russia, China is everywhere at the FIFA World Cup as the masses back home fuel unprecedented media and sponsor activity from the world’s most populous nation.From pitchside LED billboards to the teeming mixed zones and hospitality areas, China’s presence at the tournament is ubiquitous, on and off the field.Chinese sponsors lead the tournament’s advertising standings, accounting for about $835 million of a $2.4 billion global splurge. That’s $400 million more than the next biggest spender, the United States, and easily exceeds that of host country Russia, according to market-research firm Zenith.All this comes against a backdrop of a decline in interest from the Cup’s traditional Western backers as the aftershocks of FIFA’s corruption scandals continue to be felt financially."The ambition of Chinese brands going global is growing rapidly, while vacancies on the World Cup’s expanded sponsorship structure has provided a shortcut to a top international marketing platform," said Jiang Lizhang, chairman of Chinese sports marketing firm Desports, FIFA’s exclusive sponsorship agency in Asia.Chinese companies, including FIFA partner Wanda Group and sponsor Hisense Electronics Co, have taken seven of the 17 FIFA sponsor slots, a far cry from four years ago when there was only one Chinese brand involved.FIFA is not surprised."It’s something that was expected," said Franck Guignery, FIFA’s head of sales."The Chinese government’s ambition to develop the game on a national basis is impressive and the growth plays a major part in FIFA’s vision to increase soccer participation to 60 percent of the global population by 2026.”"The access offers companies that might not otherwise enter a global sponsorship deal the chance to do so. The value proposition is much stronger."Chinese media are also feasting at the FIFA table, with the World Cup’s total global audience forecast to hit 3.4 billion, according to research company GlobalWebIndex.China has sent over 300 journalists, 200 of those accredited by FIFA, to cover the event, making it the biggest media legion, barring broadcast crews, among all non-competing nations, according to a report on the Shanghai Observer website.According to China Central Television, the World Cup’s exclusive TV broadcaster in China, over 128 million viewers－almost 10 percent of the population－tuned in to watch the opening match on multiple channels."After all, only about 40,000 Chinese ticketholders could enjoy the games live in Russia. The interest in the tournament back home is staggering and this is only the beginning," said Hong Jianping, a sports communication researcher with Beijing Sport University.
