Campus food ban hides wider issues
When ordering food only takes a few minutes using a smartphone, it’s only natural that food deliveries have become part of college life. However, a university in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region is trying to put a stop to this trend on its campus.On Nov 1, Guangxi University of Foreign Languages banned food delivery services and disposable food boxes, both to its campus and dormitories, reported Xinhua News Agency.The ban immediately received fierce criticism from the university’s students, as well as internet users. Some complained that the ban made campus canteens very crowded. “There are not enough seats in the canteen, which forces us to eat standing up or squatting,” a student in the university surnamed Tan told Guangxi Television.The crowded canteens also mean that extra time is spent dining, which could have been used to nap during the lunch break. Some even complained that the canteen only provides a few dishes, most of which don’t taste so great.Su Junlv, from the university’s student affairs office, explained that the ban was carried out because off-campus food posed safety risks for students. It’s believed that takeout food had created a serious garbage problem, as there were often a large number of used food boxes found in campus garbage cans after students had finished their meals.According to Su, the ban was also brought in to help students develop a healthy lifestyle.“While food delivery services bring convenience, they let students form some lazy habits,” Su told Xinhua. “They spend a whole day in the dorm playing video games, watching TV soap operas and ordering food online.”In fact, Guangxi University of Foreign Languages is the latest example of Chinese universities banning food deliveries. According to the Chinanews website, several universities such as Beijing Language and Culture University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan have banned delivery vehicles from entering their campuses.However, in the eyes of Liu Junhai, a professor at Renmin University of China, there are other approaches that universities could take to improve their students’ meal times. “Universities should explore how to improve the dining experience in the canteens, such as the queuing and variety of dishes,” he told Xinhua.“As for the students, they should try to rely less on food deliveries and form a healthy lifestyle, as they have no guarantee for hygiene and pose a threat to the environment,” commented China Youth Daily.
