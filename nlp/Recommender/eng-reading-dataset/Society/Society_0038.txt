Tech could spell end of handwriting
A pen has always been an essential tool when it comes to taking exams. However, in this digital age, this traditional tool may become a thing of the past.Cambridge University in Britain is considering ending 800 years of written exams and allowing students to use laptops or iPads to take exams instead.The move comes after Cambridge teachers complained that students’ handwriting is becoming too hard to recognize. The fall in being able to write neatly could largely be down to the reliance on laptops in lectures and elsewhere.“There has definitely been a downward trend. It is difficult for both the students and the examiners as it is harder and harder to read these scripts,” Sarah Pearsall, a senior lecturer at the university, told The Telegraph.As a result, more and more students with poor handwriting are being forced to return to university during the summer holidays to read their answers aloud to university administrators.However, some criticized the move, fearing the handwritten word would become a lost art.Tracey Trussell, a handwriting expert at the British Institute of Graphologists, urged Cambridge to “make sure that students continue to write by hand, particularly in lectures”.She told The Telegraph that writing by hand could help students improve their memory and understand lessons better.Meanwhile, there are also concerns that primary and secondary schools could follow Cambridge’s example.In fact, a similar plan was carried out for some first- and second-year students at Edinburgh University in the UK in 2011, reported The Scotsman. Senior officials at the university believed it was unfair to expect students to use pens and paper during exams when most of their coursework was done using computers.The move also echoes the opinions of Harvard professor Eric Mazur, known as the father of the “flipped classroom”.He believes that the rise of mobile internet access means that we live in an age in which we don’t need to memorize anything.As a result, he encourages students to bring their laptops and mobile phones into exams. With these devices, students can “look up whatever they want, whenever they want” and be tested on their creative and analytical skills, rather than the ability to remember information, he said during the Times Higher Education World Academic Summit in September, according to The Guardian.
