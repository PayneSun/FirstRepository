Get ahead in race of start-ups
What entrepreneurial students mention the most when talking about challenges is their lack of experience, funding and a business location. But there is a solution for these problems: a start-up business incubator that offers rent subsidies, financial support and start-up training.Let’s take a look at some of these incubators and how students, both enrolled and fresh graduates can apply for them.Case 1: Qingdao Business Incubator Center for University StudentsMany incubators are established by national and local human resources and social security bureaus. Qingdao Business Incubator Center for University Students is one of them. It was created by the human resources and social security bureau of Qingdao, so students who set up a business there can get help from the local government.BenefitsRent subsidies: rent a subsidized business venue or even enjoy a free venue for the first yearFinancial support: apply for loans of 50,000 to 200,000 yuan; pay back the registration and management fee within 3 yearsStart-up training: attend classes and seminars held by successful businessmen and entrepreneursCase 2: Zhejiang University National Science ParkScience parks and incubators created by universities are easier for students to get help from, especially for students of the host university. Zhejiang University National Science Park is of this kind.BenefitsRent subsidies: enjoy a free venue for the first yearFinancial support: apply for funding of 50,000 to 150,000 yuan from the local government; extra funding from the universityStart-up training: classes on finance, law and taxationCase 3: business incubator for students in Hefei Economic & Technological Development AreaThere are some private funded incubators available for students. The business incubator for students in Hefei Economic & Technological Development Area, for example, cooperates with some universities, allowing their students to apply for a business venue there. The disadvantage of these incubators is that students can’t get as much help as they can get from a public funded incubator.BenefitsRent subsidies: rent with concessionFinancial support: opportunities to meet investorsHow to join a business incubator?The basic requirements and application procedure are similar for most business incubators. But there are some factors that can increase your chances of joining a business incubator.1. Start-up business teams that have won a provincial or national entrepreneurship competition have a better chance of joining a business incubator.2. Start-up business teams that are registered with Youth Business China, a non-profit program that aims to promote youth entrepreneurship, are more likely to join business incubators than those that are not.3. High-tech or innovative start-up projects have an advantage against others.
