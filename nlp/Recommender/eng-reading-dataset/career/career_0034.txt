Grads face more hurdles
This year, graduates not only face a tough job market, but also tough job requirements.Different to previous years, in which applicants’ education and work experience were the main criteria for getting a job, employers are now imposing further eligibility criteria on applicants, such as passing psychological, personality and behavioral tests.The Yangtse Evening News reported that some employers are even filtering applicants by their zodiac sign and IQ.Although the latter two criteria have been criticized for being discriminatory, the tests are upheld by HR professionals and employers as a supplementary tool for selecting suitable candidates.According to Xu Yongge, executive president of Tianjin HR Club, employers are adopting psychological, personality and behavioral tests because many students have learned interview techniques from online forums.“HRs have no choice but to use more comprehensive ways to evaluate applicants, so they’ve introduced these tests as an additional measure,” said Xu.The increasing role of such tests can be seen from the 2013 Global Assessment Trend Report released by SHL, a UK-based provider of talent measurement solutions. SHL surveyed 592 HR professionals around the world, 42 percent of them from China.The results show that increasing importance is attached to personality and compatibility tests. The usage rate of personality tests has risen from 66 percent in 2009 to 84 percent in 2013, while the use of compatibility tests increased from 62 percent in 2010 to 77 percent in 2013.Personality tests are now the second most important measure in the pre-hiring phase, behind skill and knowledge tests.Xu believes that stress has become a common problem for employees. Therefore, “evaluating employees’ mental and psychological well-being has become relevant as it can greatly affect their working efficiency”, he said.This view is echoed by Qiu Xing (with name changed as he would remain anonymous) who works in the HR department of a foreign company.“Certificates, diplomas and resumes only show an applicant’s educational experience. But with the help of tests and evaluation systems, we can fully assess their competence and suitability for the job,” Qiu told the Beijing Morning Post.Apart from big corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises in second-tier cities are also adopting such measures.According to Shenyang Daily, 48 percent of local employers use personality and psychological tests to evaluate candidates, because they think these qualities are more important than skill in the workplace.This puts an extra burden on graduates because they will be rejected if they fail the tests. But Zhang Lei, recruitment manager at Huawei, said that graduates shouldn’t worry.“Many companies use personality and psychological tests, but their aim is to select the most suitable candidate for each position. Applicants shouldn’t be afraid to show their true self,” he said.
