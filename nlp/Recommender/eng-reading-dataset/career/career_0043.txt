Get office fashion right
On hot summer days, flip-flops, shorts and miniskirts are our best friends — nothing screams “cool” more than these pieces of clothing. But think twice before you wear them to work. Your boss may hate seeing you sport these kind of clothes in the office, you could even get fired for it — seriously! So for those preparing to enter the professional world, it’s time for a quick lesson on workplace dress codes.Different companies within the same industry often have their own expectations and dress codes, but there are some general rules of thumb that tend to remain consistent within a particular profession.Financial servicesKey words: polished, professionalWhen you’re handling other people’s money, you need to present yourself as capable and professional.So the dress code in financial services firms like banks and insurance companies is usually formal, requiring dark suits, white shirts, conservative ties and polished black or brown leather shoes for men to match the serious nature of their work.For women in the financial world, the rules are less strict than those of their male cohorts. Still, the goal is to look put-together and professional — not sloppy and slutty. Tailored business suits, both dress suits and pantsuits, are acceptable choices, as are tailored blouses and slacks or skirts. Scarves and classic jewelry pieces can be applied for a touch of design and color.No-nos:T-shirtsAthletic shoes, open-toed shoes, flip-flops and sandalsClothing that is too tight or revealingJeans, pants that are too short (ankle visible) or too long (dragging on the ground)Overly-trendy prints, patterns or bright colorsLaw firmsKey word: clean, crispA decade after the dot-com boom pushed casual workplace attire into vogue, the conservative legal field is still slow to embrace the trend. Just like in the financial sector, dressing right is crucial to your image as a professional in the law industry.For court appearances and client meetings, a well-cut suit in a neutral color is necessary for both men and women. Men should wear a collared, long-sleeve white shirt with a conservative tie. Leather shoes with dark socks are ideal. Women should go for close-toed heels, and if they wear a dress suit, the skirt should fall at or below the knee.When it comes to less formal events and casual workdays, men can eliminate the tie and wear a suit with a knit shirt or golf shirt, while tailored jackets, nice blouses, knit tops and dress sandals are good choices for women.No-nos:T-shirtsShorts, jeans or cargo pantsChunky necklaces or big dangly earringsAthletic shoes, flip-flops, moccasinsTight-fitting and low-cut clothing, especially anything that shows cleavageIT industryKey words: relaxed, comfyIf you’re going to work for the IT industry, you don’t have to worry about a dress code — this is one industry where anything goes.Companies in this dynamic and broad-minded industry often have a relaxed dress code for their employees. Microsoft, for instance, is known for its JSS (jeans, sneakers, sandals) work environment.That may not be the case in every IT company, but a collared shirt with khakis will usually suffice for men, while women are free to experiment.Of course, a formal suit is still expected for client meetings.No-nos:Flip-flopsShorts
