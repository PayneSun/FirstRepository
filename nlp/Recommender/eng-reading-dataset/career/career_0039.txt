PLA move targets new talents
When finding a job is tough, why not join the army? For the first time since 1990, the PLA has started enlisting in summer and is seeking to attract college students with favorable policies aimed especially at them.Mou Mingbing from the Ministry of National Defense told Xinhua News Agency that previously the traditional enlisting season was winter, when many college graduates with much needed expertise would miss the opportunity to enlist.“We changed the enlisting season in order to attract more talents to the country’s defense cause,” said Mou last month.Gong Fangbin, a professor at the National Defence University, thinks enlisting is a good choice in the current job market.“The global financial recession offers the PLA a chance to attract much needed university talents,” said Gong.According to Gong, a number of new favorable policies aimed at college students will boost their confidence in joining the army and offer them an attractive reward after completing service.Financial support: Students who return to university after service can have their tuition fees waived or reduced. According to PLA administration, for an enrolled student to join the army, there are about 130,000 yuan stipend, bonus and subsidy paid after their service.Graduate school: Retired soldiers can earn extra points in the graduate school entrance exam within three years of their retirement. Those with a bachelor’s degree who gain a second-grade badge of honor during service can enroll into graduate school without sitting the exam.Continue to study: Students who are still enrolled at university can join the army without losing their academic credits. This means after completing service they can continue their studies from where they left off.Hukou: Graduates from colleges in Beijing who are enlisted in the capital will get a Beijing hukou if, after their retirement from the army, they are hired by an entity of any kind registered in Beijing.
