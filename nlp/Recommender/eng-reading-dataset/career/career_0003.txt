There are some new bosses in town
“We’ve had enough of these boys messing about.” This is what Anna Soubry, UK’s former business minister, said earlier last month, offering her backing of Theresa May in the running to become the UK’s next prime minister.Soubry was indicating that it was time for women to step up to “clear up the mess created by the men”.Women are starting to take power in more and more important positions in recent years. According to a new list *compiled by Agence France Presse (AFP), the world’s 10 most powerful women who made their way above the “glass ceiling”–the invisible barrier that keeps women from rising beyond a certain level in *hierarchy–includes the US’ first female presidential *nominee Hillary Clinton, head of the US Federal Reserve Janet Yellen, and Director-General of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan.There is something interesting with the AFP list though: A majority of the 10 women are over 60, the rough age when some women become grandmothers.In fact, this might be the best proof of how aging–a factor that has always been considered as a disadvantage, especially for women–has begun to turn into an edge, for women.According to The Atlantic, the reasons behind the phenomenon may include that today’s older women are better educated and experienced than any generations before.It is also because of society’s changing *perceptions about what women can achieve–after being held back in their middle age years raising kids and running domestic lives, older women are now more likely to start again instead of retiring into a peaceful life of cooking and gardening.Also, according to the UK’s Conservative peer, Baroness Jenkin of Kennington, people are growing to be more trusting toward female leaders compared to their male *counterparts, especially during periods of instability.“They feel that at a time of *turmoil, a woman will be more practical and a bit less *testosterone[-driven] in their approach. More *collaborative, more willing to listen to voices around the table, less likely to have an instantly aggressive approach to things,” she told The Guardian.In fact, this changing atmosphere in gender equality is spreading all over the world and across women of all ages.In the just-ended Rio Olympics, for example, among the 121 medals under the belt of the US team, 55 were won by men while 61 were captured by women. The rest five were in mixed events.When US gymnast Simone Biles sealed four golds and a bronze, she said, “I’m not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps. I’m the first Simone Biles.”
