Post-holiday syndrome strikes workers
It’s common when you come back to work after a long holiday to find your mind wandering, especially after Spring Festival. Psychologists and nutritionists have dubbed it post-holiday syndrome, which involves tiredness, poor appetite, muscle pains, anxiety and more, if not dealt with properly, it can take weeks to recover.Gong Bo, a customer manager with the Bank of China in Shanghai said he was even more exhausted after the "long rest," and eating too much meat over the holiday had only made the situation worse."I got an upset stomach, and I did not feel rested at all," He said. "The end of the holiday felt like the end of the world."Work shyness"It is like someone suddenly enters a dark room after spending time in sunlight, their eyes take some time to adjust," psychologist Shi Yu with the Armed Police General Hospital said. "People just cannot adapt when they take on a full schedule right after relaxing."Compared with China’s other festivals such as the National Day holiday, Wang Xufeng, a nutritionist with the China Nutrition Society, believes the post-holiday syndrome from the Spring Festival is the most noticeable.“Not only is it the most celebrated holiday in China, but Chinese people also over-indulge themselves in eating and drinking. The foods that people eat during the Spring Festival are also high in fat, a leftover tradition from the old days when food was scarce and meat was rare,”he said.Overeating and drinking also leaves many with excess winter weight to worry about.Medical college student Wang Zheyan is frustrated because she has to work out a diet plan to cater for her holiday weight."I think I intended to be extra nice to myself during the holiday," she recalled. "I let myself eat cream cakes even when I was 100 percent full!"It is also a tradition to stay up late during the festival, playing mahjong or singing karaoke. Sleep deprivation can cause problems for people with high blood pressure and heart disease.Young people who think they are strong enough to handle the lack of sleep and non-stop social activities are more likely to suffer from post-holiday syndrome. Instead of waiting for the symptoms to pass, Shi suggests that everyone be better prepared.Back to normal"It’s better we get back to a normal routine before the holiday ends, sleeping earlier and eating less," Shi said.Some employers may compromise and help workers get through the blue period, but Shi believes it is not the company’s responsibility to do that.Nutritionist Wang has some ways to help people recover from a nutritionist’s perspective."Congee, noodles and steamed bread take less time digest, while food with high fat and protein takes much longer," he explained.After irregular eating and sleeping, it is common for people to lose their appetites too, Wang said. The problem can be solved by eating food with stronger flavors, like spicy and sour dishes."Lots of vinegar, fresh lemon and tomato, it zests up the food and wakes up your stomach," he added.
