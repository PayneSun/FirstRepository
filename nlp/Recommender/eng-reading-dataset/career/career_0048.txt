West sitting on a health time bomb
The ongoing recession in the West is affecting young people in terms of less jobs and shrinking benefits. But its effects don’t stop there ― surveys reveal that the economic crisis is also bad news for the health of young people.A 2012 poll by ICM Group, a research consultancy, revealed that 43 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK feel stressed by the economic downturn, more than among other age groups.This has resulted in 24 percent of under-25s drinking more heavily and 19 percent sleeping badly, according to the poll.“This group are the least likely to visit their GP (general practitioner) to discuss health concerns, yet are being badly hit by the economic downturn,” said Dr Sarah Jarvis, a UK-based GP, commenting on the poll’s findings. “Taking time out to address health worries is not a priority for young people.”Besides their physical wellbeing, the mental health of young Westerners is also causing concern.“We are sitting on a mental health time bomb and urgent action is needed to invest in mental health support services for young people,” Lucie Russell from YoungMinds, a UK-based charity working with young people, told The Huffington Post.The World Health Organization estimates that up to 20 percent of adolescents and young people suffer from mental health problems.These problems, in turn, have a negative effect on the economy, resulting in a self-reinforcing cycle. Sleep deprivation, stress and drinking ― all these health issues reduce the working efficiency of employees and add to national healthcare costs. According to various studies, each of these health issues alone can cause billions of dollars in economic losses.For instance, sleep disorders cost the Australian economy AU$5.1 billion (32 billion yuan) every year, the majority of which is due to lost productivity at work, a report by Deloitte Access Economics revealed.In their new book The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills, David Stuckler, political economist at Oxford University, and Sanjay Basu, epidemiologist at Stanford University, highlight even more severe consequences of the recession. According to them, the economic crisis has seen more than 10,000 suicides and up to a million cases of depression across Europe and North America.But among these sobering statistics, there is good news, which is that recessions can be prevented from turning into health epidemics ― if governments respond effectively.“Worsening health is not an inevitable consequence of economic recessions,” Basu said in a statement, China Daily reported. “It’s a political choice.”Looks like it’s time to get serious about young people’s state of sub-health.
