Ten ways to get fired
1. Lying on Your ResumeTell the truth from the start, because you will be held responsible for the information you provide -- and your employer will check it.2. Being Indiscreet About Your Job HuntIf you are in the market for a new job, don’t send your resume from your office computer, which most likely is monitored by IT. Assume your instant messages and emails are fair game as well.3. GossipingWalls have ears. Keep gossip to yourself. Winding up on the wrong side of the rumor mill can cost you more than somebody’s trust; it can mean your job.4. Taking Too Many Personal CallsSpending much of your work time orchestrating your own personal business usually results in being given an opportunity to spend all of your time on the phone on personal business -- looking for a new job, Star warns.5. Drinking at WorkOne of the quickest ways to be shown the door is drinking too much at lunch and walking into a wall. Maintaining your own clarity is extremely important.6. Surfing the Web ExcessivelySpending much of your workday cruising around cyberspace puts you just a point-and-click away from unemployment. And checking adult-oriented Web sites on the job is a definite no-no.7. Becoming Romantically Involved with the BossWhile it may make for great water-cooler discussion, a boss/direct-report romance can easily end with someone out of a job. (Hint: It’s usually not the boss.)8. Forgetting to Double-Check Your FiguresWhen working with numbers, scrutinize your work carefully. One stray zero could make the difference between being employed and unemployed, advises Star.9. Alienating Your CoworkersTo do your job effectively, you’ll need the cooperation, support and good will of those around you. Becoming detached from those you work with could get you replaced with someone who can work well with others.10. Pointing the Finger at Everyone but YourselfTake ownership of your job. If you make a mistake, own up to it. Don’t try to sweep your mistakes under the carpet -- or worse yet, blame somebody else -- because the truth will usually come back to bite you on the bottom line. And nobody wants to trust or employ a liar, says Star.
