Peaceful, or just aimless?
Famous Irish poet Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) once wrote: “Ah! Realize your youth while you have it.” He pointed out the important truth about how precious youth is in one’s journey through life.However, the popular internet slang word foxi – or “Buddhist” – is challenging this norm by encouraging young people to remain calm and peaceful and avoid conflict as much as possible – in other words, to live like a Buddha.The phrase was reportedly created in Japan in 2014 to describe young men who no longer bother to start relationships with women or follow someone else’s life path. They prefer to stay in their own peaceful world without being disturbed and care little about passion and success.Now, Chinese internet users are pairing the phrase with other words to describe a similar mindset. For example, “Buddhist students” are those who study just the right amount – they don’t cut class, but they don’t burn the midnight oil, either. There are also “Buddhist parents”, who interfere little with their children’s lives and let them develop however they like – the opposite of “helicopter parents”.In this fast-changing and competitive world, it’s only natural that people are seeking a spiritual anchor.However, some would compare foxi with “demotivational culture” – a phrase that describes young people who feel aimless and powerless. They say that foxi actually reflects the reality that young people are losing their will to fight. They are pretending to keep a healthy and wise attitude toward failure simply because they’re incapable of succeeding.But no matter what, there is one thing that “Buddhist youngsters” should keep in mind: You may want to keep a calm mindset regarding failure, but you should also be passionate and positive about school, work and life.After all, Wilde also wrote: “Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.”
