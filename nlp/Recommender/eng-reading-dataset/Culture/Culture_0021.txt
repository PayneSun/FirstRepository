Anything could happen on year’s silliest day
When I was at school, April Fools’ Day was always good fun. We played tricks on each other and sometimes on the teacher. In fact, one year one of the boys at school put a bucket of water on top of the door and when the chemistry teacher came in he got very wet! It was funny, but the boy got in big trouble!When and what is April Fools’ Day?April Fools’ Day is on 1 April. It’s the custom in the UK to play a trick or a joke on someone on this day. If the person falls for the joke then they are called an “April Fool”. In fact it’s only half a day because April Fools’ Day finishes at midday. No more jokes after lunchtime, please.Here are some April Fools’ tricks from around the world:• In the 1990s a fast-food chain published an advert in a US magazine offering new “Left-handed Whoppas” for the 32 million left-handed Americans. Thousands of customers ordered the new burger in the restaurants.• A zoo in Japan said that it had a giant penguin that was 165 cm tall and weighed 80 kg. In fact it was a man dressed up in a penguin suit.• In 1949 a radio presenter in New Zealand told listeners that there were millions of wasps coming to invade. He told viewers to wear their socks over their trousers and to put honey on their doors. Millions of listeners believed him.• In 1976 a very famous British astronomer told radio listeners that at 9:47 am the Earth was going to experience a feeling of less gravity. He said that Jupiter and Pluto would cross and if listeners jumped in the air at exactly 9:47 am they would feel the sensation of having no gravity. Hundreds of listeners phoned the radio to say they had jumped and floated in the air.• A British newspaper announced that Portugal had “sold” the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo to Spain for €160 million. Why? To try to clear its national debt. It was a joke of course.
