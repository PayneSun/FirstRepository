English version of great trilogy coming soon
Despite their popularity, only three of Jin Yong’s martial arts novels have been translated into English. But English-speaking fans of Jin have something to look forward to as an English version of his most popular trilogy, Legends of the Condor Heroes, is set to hit bookstores in February.Jin Yong is the pen name of Louis Cha. This latest translation project is the most ambitious among Jin Yong’s works.The first volume of the trilogy, A Hero Born, was translated by Anna Holmwood, a Swedish translator who studied history at the University of Oxford. She took up the project in 2012 and said that one of the biggest challenges for her was translating the original pace and excitement of the book into English.“It’s all about whether the English reader will be lured by the emotions and characters. It’s important for the English version to read like an enticing work,” she said.It took a whole five years for Holmwood to finish the translation. Yet when sample paragraphs of the book first came out, some people considered certain parts of it not precise enough compared to the original Chinese story. But Holmwood didn’t regret taking up her mission.“The greatest loss that can occur in translation can only come from not translating it at all,” she wrote in the book’s introduction.
