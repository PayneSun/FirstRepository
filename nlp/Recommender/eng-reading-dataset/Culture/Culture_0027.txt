Color sends message of strength
In 2018, purple will reign.It’s been a favorite color of numerous creative geniuses. The most famous of those is the late US music icon Prince, who is well known for his hit Purple Rain, and his custom-made purple piano, which had been scheduled to go on a concert tour with the musician before he passed away last year.Purple is a color loved by many. But it wasn’t until Ultra Violet – a special shade of purple – was named 2018’s Color of the Year by the Pantone Color Institute that we started to realize that purple could also be “an empowering color”, according to Laurie Pressman, vice president of the world famous US company.“Basically, it’s all about fighting the power, being bold and strong. That’s the mood for the year ahead,” Metro lifestyle reporter Ellen Scott wrote.And even though it’s not yet 2018, we can already see that things have changed.In September, women in Saudi Arabia were finally given the right to drive, something they used to be sent to jail for doing. And in October, women all around the world started sharing their experiences of being sexually assaulted by powerful men, after keeping quiet for such a long time.“The Pantone Color of the Year has come to mean so much more than ‘what’s trending’ in the world of design; it’s truly a reflection of what’s needed in our world today,” said Pressman in a news release.Getting its name from ultraviolet, a color that’s invisible in the rainbow spectrum, Ultra Violet happens to have the same symbolic meaning. It isn’t just a color, but a way of looking at life. “It exposes things you wouldn’t be able to see under normal light,” Karin Rowland, a human rights activist in South Africa, told Mashable, referring to the movement of women’s equality.But purple isn’t just about fighting and challenging. It’s also about creating and balancing, since it comes from the mixing of two opposite colors – passionate red and calm blue.“[Ultra Violet] brings hope and an uplifting message,” Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute told The New York Time. “It communicates originality and visionary thinking that points us toward the future.”
