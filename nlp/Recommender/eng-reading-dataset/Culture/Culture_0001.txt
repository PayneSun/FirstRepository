Answering strange questions
Being enrolled in a top university is probably every student’s dream. But no matter how much you study for the application, you may come across a question that you never expected.Earlier this month, Oxford University released an admission interview question from All Souls College: “Would you like to be a vampire or a zombie?” It immediately sparked a heated discussion among the public online, as many people tried to answer the question.Vampires and zombies are two popular creatures in Western folklore. In 2009, Lucinda Rumsey, of Mansfield College at Oxford University, also asked English literature applicants about the Twilight books, a series on vampires written by US author Stephenie Meyer. “A good English student engages in literary analysis of every book they read,” Rumsey told The Telegraph.And it seems there’s no magic answer, other than the one that’s inside your head. “No matter what kind of educational background or opportunities you have had, the interview should be an opportunity to present your interest and ability in your chosen subject, since they are not just about reciting what you already know,” Samina Khan, director of admissions at Oxford University, wrote on the university’s official website.Indeed, what Oxford University really wants is to encourage its applicants to think outside the box and explore the unknown fields they previously failed to venture into, The Independent noted.Below, TEENS has picked out some other unusual university admission questions. See if you can answer them for yourself.1. Do you want to be a novel or a poem?2. How much of the past can you count?3.This is a bark. Please say something about it.
