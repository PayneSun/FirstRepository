Telling the tale of our past
On Sept 4, Gulangyu Island, off the coast of Xiamen, Fujian, was certificated a world heritage site by UNESCO. China now has 52 such sites, spread across the entire country.Millions of Chinese people visit Gulangyu Island every year to enjoy its natural delights and the mixture of foreign and Chinese architecture.The recognition of this beautiful, culturally remarkable island is an honor. But the fact that it is a heritage site means much more than that.The word “heritage” refers to the invaluable things we inherit from the past. And UNESCO’s world heritage sites, of which there are over 1,000, make a rich tapestry of memories, both natural and man-made. Like a time machine, they take us back to our ancestors and even earlier, enabling us to wonder at both the natural world and human history.This applies to all the sites around the world certificated by UNESCO, but in different ways. Places like Moscow’s Red Square stand for a particular moment in the civilization of humankind; they’re valuable cultural resources that tell a story of the past better than a history book could.But heritage can also be a reminder of a lifestyle of the past. Just look at Vienna’s coffee culture: UNESCO gave the award, not to particular cafes in Austria, but to the culture of those places; the award was for what happened there, not for the venues  themselves.At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the last century, the cafes were packed with artists and intellectuals. The popularity of these places reached its height during the last period of the great Austro-Hungarian Empire, which ended in 1918.By the 1950s, Austria’s coffee houses began to go into decline, just after television arrived and people chose to stay at home for entertainment rather than go out.Just like Gulangyu Island and Viennese cafes, every world heritage item is worthy of care and protection. They remind us of our rich and various cultural pasts, and the things that made us who we are.
