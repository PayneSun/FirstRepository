With flags, song, pride

"This is good for the morale ... Here, we are all united. We mix. There is no religion, there is nothing, and that’s what feels good." People wrapped in flags and dressed in crazy hats, and one man spotted totally nude except for the tricolor, marched down the avenue where France displayed its military might a day earlier for Bastille Day.Revelers set off smoke bombs in the national colors — blue, white and red — obscuring Napoleon’s triumphal arch. People climbed atop every newspaper kiosk and bus stop in the area to wave flags and lead the crowds below in cheers. The national anthem, the Marseillaise, rang out, cars honked horns and cherry bombs cracks.As night fell, The Eiffel Tower flashed 1998-2018 to mark France’s two World Cup titles.The Arc de Triomph was awash in the national colors, lit with the rooster, the faces of the winning team and the words "Proud to be Blue," or French.The celebrations were spread across the nation.
