Rise of ‘foodtography’
When the food we order at a restaurant arrives, the first thing most of us want to do is tuck in right away. But for every person who just wants to eat their meal, there’s another who insists on taking at least five photos of their food to share on social media.While this may seem like a recent phenomenon, “foodtography” has been around for longer than one would expect.Take US photographer Irving Penn (1917-2009) for example.In 1947, Vogue magazine published a series of food shots taken by Penn. Looking at the carefully placed salad ingredients or the series of cakes on stands, it would be easy to think Penn’s 70-year-old photos were taken just last week.Penn’s efforts aside, it seems that social media is behind the recent rise of foodtography.Today, if a social media star with thousands of followers posts just one delicious-looking food picture and mentions where it was taken, it can lead to hundreds of new customers for the restaurant or cafe.One such star is the anonymous “Clerkenwell Boy”, based in London, whose Instagram account is followed by over 100,000 people.Yet despite his popularity, the social media celebrity tries to use his influence for good by encouraging people not to waste food.Research carried out earlier this year by UK supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, published in The Guardian, found that 55 percent of the 18- to 34-year-olds it surveyed were more likely to “try unusual recipes to create Instagram-friendly dishes” than others, leading to increased food waste.“I hate stuff like a giant stack of seven burgers photographed and hashtagged just for likes. I think, ‘are they going to just throw that away now?’,” Clerkenwell Boy told The Guardian.So while it’s fun to share snaps of delicious dishes with your friends, just remember the most important thing: Don’t forget to eat your meal afterwards.
