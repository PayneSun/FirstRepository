Adult Halloween lovers taking over
Halloween used to be a time for kids. In the past, the festival meant houses decorated with jack-o-lanterns, cool costumes handmade by moms, and going door to door asking for candy, saying “trick or treat”.However, you wouldn’t have seen any of these if you were at this year’s Halloween events in Shibuya, Tokyo, from Oct 27 to 30. Halloween in Japan has become a big party for adults, who dress up in costumes and hang around having fun taking pictures. This year’s events were so popular that Tokyo police had to stop cars from entering two streets so pedestrians could pass safely. In other words, this festival is no longer just a time for kids.As USA Today editor Bruce Horovitz wrote, “Adults have slowly been stealing Halloween from kids.”But “steal” is not quite the word, since the adults of today all used to be kids themselves. These grown-ups still manage to keep the tradition of dressing up alive, however, even if they’re too old to knock on strangers’ doors for candy now.Some companies even encourage their employees to wear costumes to work so they can relax and enjoy their share of the festival fun.“You can wear whatever you want and not be judged,” Denise Delahorne of DDB Worldwide, an advertising company, told Forbes when asked why adults are so into Halloween compared to other holidays. “There’s no stress to it. You don’t have to travel or deal with relatives. There’s not the holiday pressure to find a date if you are single.”But here comes the ironic and interesting part: As the “adult Halloween” industry gets bigger and bigger, movie theaters, drink sellers and haunted houses are starting to target adult customers only. There’s even an annual Halloween trade show in the US that you can’t even enter if you’re under 16.That isn’t good news for kids, but on the bright side, at least young people can still get free candy. And what could be better than that?
