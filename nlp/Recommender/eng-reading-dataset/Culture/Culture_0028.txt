Play the game for everyone
Along with soccer, basketball is a global sport. As you read this, young people somewhere in the world are happily passing, dribbling and shooting. It’s enormous fun and a joyful way to spend time with others.Basketball is a game for everyone. Unlike golf or tennis, it doesn’t require great wealth or a lot of space to play. After all, not many people have a golf course-sized backyard, and tennis equipment is expensive. Basketball, by contrast, just needs a wall with a hoop and a ball.So after its invention by Canadian-American physical educator James Naismith in 1891, the sport took off with US city-dwellers, who quickly became attracted to the game because it suited their circumstances. Today, 126 years later, basketball remains one of the most popular sports in the US, and the National Basketball Association (NBA) has an increasing appeal to fans around the world.The success of basketball as a global phenomenon is undoubtedly related to the way African-Americans play the game. “The basketball court reflected some of the major cultural shifts in America, such as from segregation to integration,” the LIVESTRONG website noted.From the 1950s onwards, segregation rules, which had prohibited African-Americans from playing in NBA games, were no longer used in the US. In 1950, when Earl Lloyd started to play for the Washington Capital team, things began to change. Since then, most of the greats of the game have been African-Americans, like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.It’s not difficult to see that there’s a strong link between political liberation and basketball. Something of this is expressed in a quote from the US author John Edgar Wideman. He makes a connection between basketball and hope: “When it’s played the way it’s supposed to be played, basketball happens in the air; flying, floating, elevated above the floor, levitating the way oppressed peoples of this earth imagine themselves in their dreams.”
