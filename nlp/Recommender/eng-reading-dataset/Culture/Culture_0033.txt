Have a break away from electronics
It’s that time of the year again: school has started in full swing, homework is piling up and you realize that you can’t possibly wait for summer next year.“I need a holiday,” you may be thinking.But wait – is it a holiday that you truly need? When we think of holidays, we think of traveling, beaches, fun, and adventure. But the reality is, we spend most of our holidays on our personal devices. Smartphones have taken the world by storm, influencing the manner we interact with each other. Does this sound like you? If so, it sounds like you need a digital detox.One of the best things about a digital detox is the fact that anyone can do it. Whether you are a businessman or a student, everyone needs some time away from technology.Having a tech-free holiday is becoming increasingly popular especially among families because it enables them to spend quality time with each other without being distracted by texting, emails, and social media.It may seem that sending a quick text message or uploading a photo to WeChat doesn’t take so much time, but these things eventually add up without us even knowing it.It was discovered in a study conducted by travel site LastMinute.com that 90 percent of Britons spend more than four hours a day using their gadgets while they are on holiday.Whether to give yourself a digital detox is a difficult decision to make, but it may be just the thing you need to cleanse your mind, body, and soul.To help you along, it is probably a good idea to choose a remote area, somewhere close to nature, where you can truly immerse yourself and unwind, and most importantly, not be tempted to switch on your smartphone.Taking a tech-free holiday would be a good time to pick up something new, or return to hobbies which you never had time for. You could sketch the view of the coast, or take photos with your old film camera. If you’re going with friends or family, perhaps bring along some board games to spend time rekindling tired relationships.In today’s fast paced world, it’s important to find time to stop and smell the roses – without taking a selfie at the same time, that is.
