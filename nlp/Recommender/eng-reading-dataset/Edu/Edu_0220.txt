"Skills to Fight against Mom" hit the internet
"When your mother scolds you, you can look elsewhere and think about other things. Just ignore her words. But remember: such a tough attitude cannot be used often."These words are from a series of cartoons which outline skills for children to fight against their mothers. The images have created heated debate among Chinese netizens.Labeled as "a book for children aged 6 to 12 who are always scolded by their parents", the cartoons, drawn by two 10-year-old Beijing girls, list over 20 skills which children can use to deal with their mothers’ anger such as crying, pretending to be ashamed, fleeing into the toilet and pleasing her afterwards.Each skill is described with vivid pictures and humorous notes. The creativity of the young girls has amazed netizens, the "Yangtse Evening Post" reported on Thursday.According to one of the girls’ mothers, her daughter once received a poor mark in an exam, and the mother blamed her and compared her performance with another classmate. The daughter’s feelings led to her creating the cartoons.The girl’s father, who first posted the pictures on his Sohu Microblog on Monday, said he hopes parents take heed of the pictures, allow children to feel free to develop their own characteristics and try not to criticize them so often.The father said the cartoons aren’t finished yet; his daughter will continue with them when she has time.The cartoons, although maybe an individual case, reflects a modern phenomenon and some of the problems within Chinese family education, said Yu Qinfang, an expert on family education in Shanghai.According to a survey of 104 children and their parents, Yu discovered that as many as 51.9 percent of primary school students hate being urged to do things by their mothers.Not giving children enough time and hurrying them to do thing seems to be a very tiny detail within family life, but it is potentially a huge problem which can easily be ignored by parents, said Yu. A mother’s blame may lead to negative feelings within her child’s heart, Yu said; parents should learn to blame less and be more patient.
