Viral post targets singles
“Singles Day”–held annually on Nov 11–is a popular day for college students to declare their love to someone they’ve had a crush on. But this year, colleges seem to be buzzing with romance a bit earlier than usual.An article entitled “The Protocol for Love Confessions on Singles Day” (《光棍节表白条例》) was posted online last week. The protocol is targeted at several universities, and it includes 10 items that either give advice or prohibit certain behaviors to prevent “Singles Day” activities from getting out of hand.As convincing as the article was, the post was soon found to be a hoax.Those universities have issued official declarations denying their involvement. But the fact that the article was read thousands of times in one day says how popular the occasion is.“The prevalence of campus love confessions is a sign that our culture is becoming more open and tolerant, and that, in turn, provides a platform where students can freely act out their ideas,” commented the Chongqing Economic Times.That said, proclamations of love should be done with certain ground rules in mind.“The protocol actually makes sense in a way,” said Zhao Caixia, 21, at Yichun University, Jiangxi. “As much as I admire the courage of students who confess their love, it’s important that the activity doesn’t disturb other people’s lives.”The fake protocol overlooks the fact that declarations of love don’t have to be public at all. Creating a big scene is not the only method to show your affection.A freshman at Anhui University, who prefers to be known by his pseudonym “Desolate Rain”, took a low-key approach, and it worked just as well.He started by becoming friends with the girl and taking care of her in a subtle but thoughtful way. After they knew each other well enough and developed a healthy friendship, he picked the right moment to let her know his feelings.“Personally, I think this approach is more sincere and avoids giving the impression of being hasty,” he said. “Being friends with each other first gives relationships a solid foundation. Otherwise it can easily collapse even if the confession goes well.”
