Disquiet over student drivers
Each year universities and colleges across the country are seeing more students arriving for the new school year along with their own private cars.Students driving to school is common and well accepted in some foreign countries, but the growing trend in China is causing controversy.The contrast in expenses for those students who drive and those who don’t is striking.Li Chaoran, 21, an English major at Beijing Foreign Studies University has driven his car to school since the start of term. He said that he spends about 2,000 yuan ($301) per month on his car, including petrol, cleaning and parking costs.Support from parentsIt is parents who are supporting the cost of maintaining and running students’ cars.Chang Chao, a college student, said that every month, his parents put 2,000 yuan in his account as a subsidy for running a car.For some students, a car is an inducement to work harder.Lin Kai, a sophomore at the Communication University of China, said that he got the car from his father as a gift to celebrate success in the gaokao (national college entrance examination) a year ago.Lin’s family only provide him with 500 yuan per month for petrol money, and keeps his living expense at about 1,200 yuan. "After getting the car, I felt the economic pressure. It encouraged me to study harder, to have a better future," he said.Some drivers don’t deny the fact that, to some extent, they get a sense of superiority when driving a car on campus. But they claim they try to keep a low profile and do not intend to show off.Outside opinionSome teachers express concern about the trend. Wang Zhi, a teacher from Chongqing University, does not welcome students driving to school."Some students drive to showoff," he said."They are young and they race on the roads, and because of their lack of experience they are dangerous," he said."More students driving to school also encourages a culture of luxury consumption on campus."Liu Hua, mother of a college student, said that many families are now so well-off that they can afford to buy a car for their children, which only increases children’s dependence."It is necessary to master the skill of driving, but more importantly, students should learn how to earn what they want by themselves, not always depend on parents." said Liu.
