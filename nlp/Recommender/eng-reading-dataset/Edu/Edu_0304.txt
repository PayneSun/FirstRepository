Graduates 'to take low-paid jobs'
The majority of students leaving university in coming months do not expect to land decent jobs, it was revealed, as the recession continues to have a “profound effect” on the employment market.Thousands of final-year degree students are preparing to accept low-paid work in bars, supermarkets and call centres, according to figures.As thousands of undergraduates take end-of-course exams this month, it emerged that only a quarter of those on arts and humanities courses were preparing to secure work in graduate professions.The disclosure came in a survey of more than 16,000 final year students – a fifth of those nationally – by analysts High Fliers Research.It comes despite fears that graduates are facing record levels of debt this summer, with the average student being forced to repay £18,100 for a three year course. Debts rise to £25,700 in parts of London.The jobs shortage was blamed on a “substantial backlog” in the number of jobless graduates from previous years – creating additional pressure on the employment market in 2010.Researchers said 8,000 extra job applications had been made to leading companies by the end of October as students attempted to steal a march on competitors.It was also disclosed that thousands of students are preparing to take a postgraduate course as an alternative to finding a job. Some 26 percent of students will remain in higher education after completing degrees this year, figures show.According to the study, 36 percent of students believe they will start a graduate job – or start looking for one – when they leave university this summer. Numbers slump to 25 percent among arts and humanities students.Some 26 per cent of all students are preparing to move on to postgraduate courses, while a third will take “any job they are offered”, the study said. This suggests large numbers of students will embark on low-paid jobs in shops, cafes, call centres and building sites – failing to use their degree for many years.
