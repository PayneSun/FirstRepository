Power of books illuminates hidden beauty of life
Zhou Fengqin became a campus celebrity recently. The 57-year-old dormitory supervisor was invited by Li Peigen, president of Wuhan-based Huazhong University of Science and Technology, as a special lecturer on reading for students, as World Book and Copyright Day approached on April 23.During her 10 years of service, Zhou has read hundreds of books from the university library by borrowing students’ library cards.“Reading is such a blessing; cherish it because you are lucky to have such top-class facilities on campus,” Zhou told the students.But experts see problems in the reading habits of students, warning that they are reading in a fragmented, pragmatic and insufficient manner, which undermines their ability to think, comprehend and analyze.Scholars therefore suggest immersive reading as a way to improve the personal cultivation of students and their aesthetic taste.Insufficient and fragmentedThe interest of college students in reading books has been eroded by the Internet.According to a survey by Xiamen Evening News last year, 43 percent of college students in the city read for less than an hour every day, while 48 percent of college students spend more than four hours online on a daily basis.“The overdependence on the Internet for information leads to skipping logic and superficial analysis,” said Zhu Gang, dean of the School of Foreign Studies at Nanjing University. “They are too distracted by the scattered information to think deeply.”Hou Yiling, English literature professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, agrees. It’s not that students aren’t reading enough information, it’s the way they are reading that has become problematic, he said.“In an era of information explosion, students read information in a large quantity,” said Hou. “However, this information is highly fragmented and inconsistent, which holds little value for thought training.”Instead, Hou suggests “immersion reading”, in which students spend time reading books in a consistent manner in order to focus their attention and organize their newfound perspectives.“It takes time to form integrated thoughts before venturing into deeper comprehension and analysis,” said Hou.Pragmatic trendLuo Yuming, Chinese literature professor at Fudan University, sees a trend of pragmatic reading among students.In a 2011 survey conducted by China Youth Daily, 56.7 percent of recipients said they wanted to read “more practical” books. The books most frequently read by young people in China are about succeeding in exams and career life. Classics are no longer at the top of the list.“Facing intense competition, people now expect a material return from taking time to read,” said Luo. “When life attitudes slant toward materialism, young people turn their backs on classic literature and philosophy.”But Hou insists students pick up humanity texts and classic works of literature for their own good.“The habit of reading, to some extent, reflects whether students have been well educated,” said Hou. “The aesthetic taste developed by reading will influence their life quality in the long term.”After Zhou Fengqin’s lecture on how she enjoyed reading without any “practical” pursuits, president Li Peigen from Huazhong University of Science and Technology sent her a postcard, which said: “Reading and dreaming make your life very beautiful.”
