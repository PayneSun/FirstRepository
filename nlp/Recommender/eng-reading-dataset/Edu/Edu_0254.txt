False romance for money
Most Chinese college students aren’t exactly flush with cash, and plenty of them would jump at the opportunity to earn 10,000 yuan a month – simply by attracting customers to buy wine in a bar.But Fengling (pseudonym), 21, a self-proclaimed "pub hustler," would tell them that it’s a job filled with deception, deceit and hurt feelings.Fengling was a graduate student at a college in Zhengzhou, where she worked as a pub hustler. As a pub hustler, she earned a nice salary through cheating or seducing strangers to buy wine in the pubs that hired her.Recently, Fengling contacted reporters from Orient Today, telling them of her experience in a bid to warn others to stay away from what otherwise might seem like a cushy gig.Internet appointmentsIn fact, Fengling did not have to chat with her "customers" in person in the very beginning; instead, many young boys, dubbed "keyboard players" would contact the customers via the Internet initially.Generally speaking, these keyboard players were also under control of the pub owner, and they were tasked to look for rich and middle-aged unmarried men and entice them to go on a date with the pub hustlers.Romantic temptationsIn this way, the keyboard player would ask for a date with the stranger under the name of "Fengling," setting up a specific place and time and reporting it to the pub owner. Finally, the owner would send Fengling to meet with the stranger.Fengling would appear cute and coquettish, chatting up the man during a nice evening stroll. Suggesting dinner, she would invariably bring the man to her employer’s establishment.Dinners with Fengling were invariably lavish affairs.Unsurprisingly, Fengling’s dates only rarely declined her dinner and drink suggestions.The cheating continuesDepending on how wealthy the man seemed, the deception would only deepen further. In the middle of dinner Fengling would receive a call from her "roommate," telling her she’d lost her house keys – "can I come by the restaurant and pick up your set?" Of course Fengling would acquiesce – and invite the roommate to join her and her date in another few bottles of wine.The dates would end with a drunk, almost broke victim that Fengling would pop into a cab and send home.Not an isolated caseFengling is not the only student to have worked in this decidedly dishonest – though not technically illegal – field.Even pub staff have admitted to using beautiful girls to dupe their male customers.Likewise Li Chenjun, an employee at Beijing’s CN Club, said that fierce competition between bars leads to a veritable arms race in who can employ the most beautiful female face.Wang Hongcai, an education professor at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that most students became pub hustlers because they feel they have no other way to earn an equivalent salary – a small fortune for most students."People all took these students pub hustlers for cheaters, but I think it’s a true sign of desperation," Wang said.
