Holiday on campus
Spring Festival is a time to get together and do all the little things you enjoy.As most university students are packing their bags, boarding trains or flying home, some will stay behind to spend the holiday on campus.Zhou Yunyun, 22, a senior finance major at Jilin University, has decided that instead of traveling to Hainan province he will kill the time by playing computer games with his online friends.“I’m used to chatting and playing with them every day. We send each other gifts frequently. It’s just fun to make friends this way,” he said.Zhou found it too expensive to fly all the way home, which would have cost him about 6,000 yuan for a return trip.Now he can save that money for job-hunting.“When I returned home in past years, my relatives always asked me a lot of questions about my plans after graduation. They had high expectations for me, which made me feel stressed,” said Zhou.The campus, usually bustling with life, will probably turn into a ghost town, with most restaurants, shops and student centers closing during the break.But there are a few advantages, according to Jia Debao, 21, a junior majoring in administration at China Agricultural University.“I might feel a bit lonely, but at least I can stay away from my parents’ nagging and enjoy the peace and quiet,” he said. “More importantly, I can enjoy the high speed of the Internet, I can always find empty seats in classrooms, and I don’t have to wait to use the bathroom.”Students who are employed by universities will also stay on campus. Library assistant Lan Zini, 19, a sophomore majoring in law at Sichuan University, is one of them.“I will stock up on instant noodles before the holiday starts,” he explained. “That way I can stay in the dormitory all day long to watch movies and TV dramas.”But education experts recommend students who stay on campus to come up with more interactive plans. That’s because communication in the virtual world can’t replace real life interpersonal relationships.Society has promoted a kind of “couch potato” or shut-in culture among young people, according to Shi Tongyu, a researcher at the Journalism and Communication Studies Department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.He warned that this trendy lifestyle can damage students physiological and psychological development.“When you constantly stare at a computer screen and type on your keyboard, you gradually lose the ability to socialize and survive normally,” said Shi.“A human’s most important task is to survive, which cannot be accomplished by staying at home all the time. Instead, it must be achieved through real life experience and communication.”
