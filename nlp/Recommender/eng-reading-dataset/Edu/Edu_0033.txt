Diaosi find struggle everywhere
JAPAN: Quitting the race before it beginsJapanese culture is known for its emphasis on hard work and educational competition. Beginning in primary school, Japanese students engage in rigorous studies and testing.Students are pushed to their limits in hopes that, once they complete their education, their efforts will pay off in the form of a stable career with a good company. But many Japanese are discovering competitive educational credentials no longer guarantee success.“There is a feeling among young generations that no matter how hard we try, we can’t get ahead,” Shigeyuki Jo, 36, told The New York Times. “Every avenue seems to be blocked, like we’re butting our heads against a wall.”Yet according to a survey conducted by the Japanese government, levels of youth satisfaction reached 78.4 percent in 2014, the highest they’ve been since 1967.University of Tokyo researcher Noritoshi Furuichi believes this increase in happiness is because young Japanese are giving up on competitiveness and focusing on living in the moment.“‘Enjoy today, tomorrow is coming’ encapsulates the mentality that increasingly absorbs Japan’s youth,” Furuichi wrote in a blog post for the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research.“This ‘consummatory’ mindset is where, rather than striving towards long-term goals, the focus is on having fun in the ‘here and now’.”US: Stressed but optimisticMany outside the US continue to see the country as one of opportunity, and despite being in a tough economic position, research shows many young Americans would agree.Eric Andersen, 25, graduated from the University of Iowa in 2010. Jobless and saddled with $15,000 (91,805 yuan) in student loan debt, he moved back in with his parents while he continued searching for employment.“I applied for jobs like it was my job,” Andersen told The Gazette. As has been the case for many other American millennials, Andersen’s determination paid off. He eventually landed a job as an editor.Like their Japanese counterparts, young Americans have reorganized their values in order to remain positive through harsh economic times.While making money still remains important to millennials, few expect to make as much as their parents did.These lowered expectations have made it easier for young Americans to appreciate what they do have.According to the Pew Research Center, among those ages 18 to 34, 88 percent say they either have or earn enough money now or expect they will in the future.“While young people are less likely now than they were before the recession to say they currently have enough income, their level of optimism is undiminished from where it was in 2004,” reported Pew.
