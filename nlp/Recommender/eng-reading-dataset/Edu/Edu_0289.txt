Oxford Univ. to open school of government
Europe’s first major university department established to promote research into government and public policy will open in Oxford under new plans.In a hugely significant move, Oxford University will create a new school of government in 2012 following an unprecedented £75 million donation by Leonard Blavatnik, the American industrialist and philanthropist.The school is intended to train outstanding graduates from across the world in the skills and responsibilities of government.The move is being backed by world leaders including Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, the former US president, and Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general.Prof Andrew Hamilton, Oxford’s vice-chancellor, said: “The school represents a huge milestone in Oxford’s history. It will give tomorrow’s leaders the best of Oxford’s traditional strengths alongside new and practical ways of understanding and addressing the challenges of good governance. ”“The university has educated 26 British Prime Ministers and over 30 other world leaders, yet until now the major international schools of government have all been outside Europe, principally in the United States.”Under plans, the Blavatnik School of Government will provide a series of practical courses leading to a Master’s degree. It will cover a range of subjects including the humanities, social sciences, law, science, technology, health, finance, energy and security policy.The school will also create 40 new academic posts.Oxford said Mr Blavatnik’s donation was one of the most generous in the university’s 900 year history.The university itself will be investing an additional £26m in the school, as well as land in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, where the school will be located.Mr Blavatnik, who was due to attend the school’s launch in Oxford, said: “Oxford University’s reputation provides the school with the opportunity to bring together distinguished teachers and leaders in government to address the entire spectrum of policy issues.”Lord Patten, Oxford’s chancellor, said: “This is a once-in-a-century opportunity for Oxford. Through the Blavatnik benefaction, Oxford will now become the world’s leading centre for the training of future leaders in government and public policy – and in ways that take proper account of the very different traditions, institutions and cultures that those leaders will serve. It is an important moment for the future of good government throughout the world.”
