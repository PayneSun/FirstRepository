Student 'spy' exposes phony firm
A student who found the company he worked for was bilking job applicants out of money, turned himself as an undercover investigator and successfully brought the company to court.As a result of Han Yuqi’s investigation, two principals of the empty-shell Wuhan Xindingcheng Business Trading Company surnamed Luo and Xu, were each fined 3,000 yuan ($453) by People’s Court in Wuhan’s Hongshan district in Hubei Province.Han, 25, a human resources management student at Branch School of Huazhong Normal University, had worked as a security guard at his university. Last April, he saw an online employment ad posted by Wuhan Dingcheng for a human resources assistant for its "inside" staff.Not as it seemed"I went to work on April 6 but found something strange only one day later," Han said.First, the employment ad said that the company was a large-scale one with hundreds of employees, but there were only five, including him - Luo and Xu and two women responsible for meeting job applicants.Second, many applicants passed the initial interview and paid 200 yuan to the company as a physical examination fee, but only a few passed the checkup at the hospital.Trick questionsThe employment procedure included an interview, a health checkup and a written examination. But there were tricks in all three procedures, according to Han.During the interview, the applicants were asked questions such as "how long have you been in the city", "which relatives do you have in the city", "what are their jobs"."If an applicant’s relatives worked in local government offices, the public security office or court, which might bring risk to the company, they quickly ended the interview," Han said.’Failing’ the physicals“The exam fee was actually 60 yuan, but every applicant paid 200 yuan."Applicants also needed to sign a contract with the company after passing the interview, which had strict requirements regarding eyesight, heart rate and blood pressure.During the health checkup, Han’s colleagues always took the applicants up a staircase to the third floor, then quickly walked them down to the first floor saying "the line was too long on the third floor."But when they returned to the first floor they were then taken up the stairs again to the second floor.The purpose was to disturb the applicants’ normal heartbeat, making them unable to meet the physical standard.In order to reduce the suspicion, the company let a few job seekers pass the health checkup and arranged a written examination for them. But examinees were given only 10 minutes to finish and no matter how the paper was completed, they failed, Han said.Going undercoverTo expose the company, on April 12 last year Han called Wuhan-based Chutian Metropolis Daily for help."A reporter surnamed Zhou said that I need evidence. So I decided to go undercover to collect it," he said.From then on, Han provided all the information he collected for the reporter every night. During his 50 days, he got the company’s fake business license, its contracts with employees and the clinic register record at a local hospital. Last July, the local police arrested Luo and Xu.But because many victims were unwilling to testify, the police only found Luo and Xu guilty of cheating 15 applicants out of 3,000 yuan.
