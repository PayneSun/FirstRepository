Let's put our heads together
People used to think of creativity and innovation as a flash of wit or a bit of good thinking. But 10 student-groups competing in a national marketing contest, designed to promote Lenovo’s latest notebook, got a different look at creativity.Last week’s event showed them that it could also come from group research, teamwork, and compromise.Liu Jie, vice-president of Lenovo, described the students’ work as "shockingly practical and original".Liu thinks that this kind of real-product-based competition lets students learn more than just promoting a product by themselves. It explores the whole business process and, more importantly, how to improve one’s overall ability.Beijing University of Posts and TelecommunicationsBy separating the student consumers into female and male groups, different sales strategies were arrived at. For instance, there were PC games for the males and group purchases for females.Comments：None of the team members were economics majors, and that helped them not to take a "should-be" approach to the issue. Every team member had unique ideas.They fought over the issue in process, which was really inefficient.Then the team decided to give everyone a chance to present their own idea, then the group took them all to make a perfect marketing plan.Good thinking was far from enough, so specific work was assigned to everyone and set deadlines to ensure project’s success.Shanxi University of Finance and EconomicsEmphasizing youth culture, using personalized notebook options to attract young consumers.Comments：As marketing majors, they are taught theories.

That unity kept the team from giving up and we tried new and better ideas.Zhejiang Gongshang UniversityPromoting love-themed notebook for campus couples with discounts and a souvenir.

They even visited groups on faraway campuses for inspiration.By analyzing all of the competing plans, team members found ways to improve on other people’s ideas and better develop their own.Judge’s comments: Qi Xin, editor-in-chief of V-marketing magazine, BeijingThe students did a great job, not only in marketing, but also in developing social and personal skills.Through research and positioning the products in front of the target group, they could learn how to explore their own advantage and better see how to make use of that advantage.They also learned how best to promote themselves in future job hunts.At this kind of national event, they made friends with students from all over the country and already have started building "business" connections.
