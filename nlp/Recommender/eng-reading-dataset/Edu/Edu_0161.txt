Thefts in college are worrisome
Wang Jinjing, a freshman at a Nanchang-based college, thought he was prepared for everything on campus life, including doing the laundry and eating healthy. Everything except for one thing: theft.One day the 18-year-old was shocked to discover that his laptop, a mobile phone and some cash had been stolen overnight.“The school said it was a fellow student who had stolen my things and that they had already admitted their mistake,” said Wang.A recent report entitled Green Book of Campus Crimes issued by a local procuratorate in Wuhan indicates that campus crime, especially theft, has been on the rise. Experts say that misconceptions of wealth might be to blame for the trend.There are over 38 universities and colleges under the jurisdiction of Hongshan Procuratorate of Wuhan, including top institutions such as Wuhan University, Central China Normal University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology, covering approximately 800,000 students. During the past five years, 238 crimes involving 264 students have been filed, according to the Green Book.“Over 75 percent of campus crimes are theft and the number of cases are on the rise,” said Li Chen, an official from Hongshan Procuratorate who asked to remain anonymous due to the nature of his job. “It is a very worrisome sign, both for campus safety and student ethics.”Local police investigated a case of organized theft on a Wuhan-based campus in June last year and found a student stealing laptops from classmates before passing them to others to sell, splitting the proceeds.According to Xiao Jianqun, a local police officer in Wuhan, the majority of students facing charges of theft regretted their actions and cited a sense of vanity and envy as the reason for their behavior.Liang Yan, from the student affairs office at the Southwestern University of Science and Technology, views the phenomenon as an extension of wider social issues.“Campuses, like society, are witnessing an increasing gap of wealth among students,” said Liang. “You can see some students driving posh cars, while their roommates have a budget of only 300-yuan for the month.”Officer Xiao suggests students be more cautious. “Nowadays, students have all kinds of gadgets and they are easy targets if they let their guard down thinking that nothing can happen on campus.”According to Hongshan Procuratorate, 17 universities and colleges in Wuhan are setting up associations for campus crime prevention in order to tackle the problem.“Any campus crime, theft included, can have a great impact on students’ mindsets,” said Li Chen. “Minimizing campus crime is beneficial for students and the future of the country.”Freshman Wang feels the atmosphere in the dormitories has changed since the thefts happened. Although no one talks about it, there is a tension among the students and everyone is locking up their valuables.“I don’t like the feeling of distrust among fellow students,” said Wang.
