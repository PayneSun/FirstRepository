Five boys arrested after Lancashire school fire
Five boys are suspected of starting a fire that wrecked their school on the eve of the new term.Pupils were faced with the prospect of coursework having been destroyed in the blaze at Leyland St Mary’s Catholic Technology College in Lancashire.Plans were being drawn up to provide alternative classrooms for 730 children, with parents warned to keep them at home for at least the rest of the week.The 1950s science block was reduced to rubble in Sunday’s blaze, which created clouds of smoke visible for miles. Sources said the library and sports hall were also wrecked beyond repair.Strong winds and a shortage of water hampered 125 firemen trying to bring it under control.Police said yesterday that five boys – one aged 11, two 12-year-olds, one aged 13 and one 15 – arrested on suspicion of starting the fire had been released on bail until later this month. Parents said the suspects all attended St Mary’s.Firefighters were expected to remain at the scene until late this afternoon. Staff were due to attend the school yesterday for an inset day, and pupils were to return for lessons after the holidays today.St Mary’s headteacher Kathy McNicholas fought back the tears as she watched her school go up in flames last night.She said: ‘This is so upsetting to watch. It’s heart-breaking. It’s very distressing for the staff and for the children. Everyone had been looking forward to coming back for the new school year.‘Finding somewhere for around 730 children won’t be easy. A few of the staff have turned up to see if there is anything they can do and they have all been shocked and saddened by what has happened.‘It’s tragic because we have only just had a lot of refurbishment work done to the school during the summer break. It was a big investment. The community around here very much looks after its school.’
