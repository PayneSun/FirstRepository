Stray cats get helping hand
It was not the first time for Shi Benliang, a senior physics major at Peking University, to feed cats. But the 22-year-old felt sad when he saw the scars and wounds on the bodies of the little creatures.“I can imagine how they have suffered from being abandoned. They lead a harsh life wandering around,” said the student.“I often see stray cats on campus and I feel like I should give them a little warmth and care before I graduate.”Shi is one of a dozen students at the university who volunteered to feed the stray cats on campus during the winter break.Recruited by the Stray Cat Rescue Association at the university through a Bulletin Board System (BBS), he took turns with other students to care for the homeless animals while the campus was empty, so that they can stay healthy.It is estimated that there are more than 100 stray cats on the campus of Peking University, including the famed “academic cat” which sometimes appears in lectures. Jin Jing, 18, an economics freshman at the university, cared for the cats for two days.“At around 5 pm each day I cycled to the 22 feeding sites on campus marked on a special map,” she said. “At each site I left some cat food and water.”Jin, who has never had pets, was excited when the animals rushed to her feet, purring loudly. They were just like human beings with distinct personalities.“Some are shy and timid, and others are more outgoing. Each of them has their own name such as ‘Sweet Orange’ or ‘Karl Marx’,” she said. “By feeding them I learned to respect life.”Liu Chenhao, a senior electronics and computer science major, who is in charge of the association, said that feeding was just one part of their responsibilities.“Our aim is to keep the stray cats in check and maintain harmony between them and the students on campus,” he said.The organization also takes cats to the animal hospital to be treated for oral and skin disease. Another of its major tasks is to find new homes for the cats by uploading their photos and information online.“We’re very careful when selecting owners and ask them lots of questions to ensure that they won’t desert their cat under any circumstances, such as when they move house or get married,” Liu said.But he stressed that their acts of kindness shouldn’t encourage anyone to abandon their cat. “A cat’s normal life expectancy is more than 10 years, but a stray one may survive for only two or three.”Mou Di, 22, a senior chemistry major, also helps with feeding the cats. “I can’t tolerate any act that harms these creatures,” she said.
