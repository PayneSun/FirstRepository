14-year War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression a consensus
"The revision is a correction," said Li, explaining that the six years of resistance before 1937 -- which included the establishement of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and the Suiyuan Campaign -- is ignored if the clash is described as lasting eight years. He believes the run-up to the war was gradual, and setting the starting point as 1937 is not completely accurate.According to Li, the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued five documents to oppose the Japanese invasion immediately after the September 18 Incident, and declared war against Japan in April 1932. Li said the Museum of the War of Chinese Peopleâ€™s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression adopted the 14-year definition back in 2005, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the end of the war.With regards to the history between 1931 and 1937, Chinese historians used to focus more on domestic issues, such as Soviet areas, encirclement campaigns and the Long March, Li said. Nowadays, however, scholars have revised their evaluation of anti-Japanese campaigns by the CPC and Kuomintang during this era.
