Tsinghua grad takes on new job as chengguan
Net users are optimistic that a 25-year-old Tsinghua University graduate who accepted an entry-level position as a chengguan (urban management officer) in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region can help to reverse the group’s negative image.The student, surnamed Wei, graduated two years ago before applying for the job - one that some of his new colleagues questioned as the right fit for a prestigious Tsinghua graduate. The main responsibility of the job is to monitor the sanitary conditions of the streets. Moreover, reports about chengguan having conflicts with street vendors have increased in recent years, with some people questioning the urban management system. But Wei said that he is happy to work the 1,600 yuan monthly-job and contribute to maintaining the city’s environment and sanitation conditions.As a result, some people have questioned why a man with a good education background would apply for such a job.Wei said he did not try to search for job in the first two years after graduation because he was afraid of the pressure that came with employment.According Xinhua News Agency, more Tsinghua graduates are picking grassroots jobs, with nearly 50 percent choosing to work outside Beijing last year.According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, employment pressure for college graduates is increasing, with 3 million new graduates having difficulties finding a job.Like his mother, many Net users are also supporting Wei’s decision, saying that workers with a higher education may be more insightful and apt to raise the bar of some of the low-quality level of workers who have angered the public by abusing their power."I am hopeful that fresh minds like Wei entering the chengguan force will be able to bring much-needed reforms to the old system," said Net user Caijiefangcaicai.Net user Yuexizaixianmingyue added that Wei was clever to take the job, saying that his university degree is likely to help him climb the ladder quickly.But some people like Net user Kuailemaya said that it was a sad day for Tsinghua University, which trains the nation’s brightest students to do more with their education - an accomplishment that Wei has wasted by taking such a job.Net user Maowuya disagreed, however, saying that working as a chengguan is similar to serving as a civil servant.Others, meanwhile, did not understand all the fuss. "So a Tsinghua graduate has decided to become a chengguan - it’s not that big of a deal. Why should all of the school’s students become officials or entrepreneurs?" wrote Net user Aijiaokouxiangtang.
