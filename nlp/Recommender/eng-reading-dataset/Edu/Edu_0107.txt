Teacher wore same outfit for 40 years
A gym teacher is retiring after a 40-year career - and taking his trademark yearbook outfit with him.Dale Irby, 63, accidentally wore the same clothes - a brown v-neck sweater and groovy white patterned shirt- for the school yearbook photo in both 1973 and 1974.When his wife Cathy, also a teacher, dared him to wear the outfit for the third-year running at Prestonwood Elementary in Texas, Mr Irby accepted the challenge - and ran with it.Each time his picture was taken during his 40-year career, he reached for his old favorite threads.He told the Dallas Morning News: ’I was so embarrassed when I got the school pictures back that second year and realized I had worn the very same thing as the first year... After five pictures, it was like: ’’Why stop?’’’He said that he wore the outfit because he had been instructed to smarten up instead of wearing his usual gym shorts for the school picture.With each passing year, the frames change, the mustache gets a little bushier and the hair begins to grey - but the outfit stays the same.Mr Irby added that it is the same shirt he’s been using for every photograph which he can still get into - as long as he sucks his stomach in a little.The school principal said Mr Irby’s legacy would be that he taught all his school children the value of good sportsmanship and to respect others. The school gym has been renamed in his honor.
