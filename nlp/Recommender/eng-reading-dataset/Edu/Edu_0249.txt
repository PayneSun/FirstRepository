Female graduates expected to perform erotic services
In today’s cutthroat job market for recent graduates, even the most stellar resume isn’t usually enough to land a well-paying and secure job. Most job-seekers know they might need something extra to make them stand out in an interview – but most still wouldn’t be prepared for what some recruiters have asked them to do: perform erotic services for the boss.Inappropriate requestsKe Shuichong, 22, a graduating student majoring in secretarial services at a Beijing-based university, is one such case.After sending her resume to a "State-owned construction engineering corporation" several days ago to apply for the position of secretary for the president, Ke received a message from an HR worker who asked her to conduct a job interview through QQ."I felt quite strange because I’d never heard of a professional company holding a job interview through QQ," Ke said. But Ke still attended the interview, during which the first questions the HR worker asked her were "Are you good-looking?" and "Can you send your photo to me?"Although growing more uncomfortable by the minute, Ke still followed the worker’s instructions."The worker told me that I could earn more than 8,000 yuan per month if I was ready to do some ’extra’ work," Ke said awkwardly. "When I asked him what the extra work is, the worker bluntly told me that I might need to offer erotic services to the boss."Ke was totally shocked and firmly declined the offer, even after being promised a salary of 150,000 yuan a year.Ke is not the only girl with stories of a job interview involving inappropriate questions.Illegal recruitmentsEven the initial classified ads posted online often stray into inappropriate territory, listing requirements that companies expect from their applicants such as physical features, temperament and height.Wu Minjun, a lawyer specializing in labor protection at the Beijing Yonghao Law Firm, told the Global Times that the candidates can report the companies to their local human resources bureaus if they’ve been the victims of such incidents.Wu left out the possibility that a female interviewee could sue her recruiter for sexual harassment even if she isn’t formally hired by the company.Staying on guard"Female students looking to be secretaries need to remain on guard against these types of operations," Wang Jian, a manager with marketing department of 51job.com, told the Global Times. "For one thing, it’s very rare that any respectable enterprise will hire a fresh graduate to serve as secretary to the company president."He said that students should be wary if asked to conduct an interview over QQ or other chat programs, and that students should conduct proper research about the company before their interviews.Wang Hongcai, an education professor at Xiamen University, said that universities also need to do a better job of preparing graduating students, especially females looking to serve as secretaries, for potentially inappropriate interviews and other situations. "Just giving them better skills at how to judge the integrity of companies they might be interested in working for would be a big help," he said.
