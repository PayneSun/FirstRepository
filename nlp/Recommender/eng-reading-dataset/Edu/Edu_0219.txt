Policies ease the pressure
With decent scores in language tests and convincing personal statements, students hoping to study overseas still need to think about a big issue: money.Fortunately, this year, popular destinations for overseas study, including Australia and Canada, have adopted policies which can lighten applicants’ financial burdens.Meanwhile, some countries have made applying easier and offered more job opportunities to attract international students.21st Century reporter Xu Jingxi interviewed education consultants. They explained the latest policies to help you choose your destination wisely.AustraliaConsultant: Chen Juan,Aoji Enrollment Center of International Education LtdA series of policies came into effect on November 5.1. Besides IELTS, student visa applicants can now also use scores in TOEFL, PTE Academic or CAE to prove their language ability to the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship.Usually, applicants need to score at least 5.0 in IELTS to get student visas. A score of 5.0 in IELTS equals 35 in TOEFL iBT test, 36 in PTE Academic, and 41 in CAE.2. Those who are going to Australia for a bachelor’s degree or a master’s now need to save less money in their bank accounts for the financial guarantee.The amount of money used to cover tuition fees and living expenses for 24 months in Australia. Now it’s only 18 months. It saves applicants about 24,000 Australian dollars (155,002 yuan).3. The Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship now scrutinizes applicants’ reasons for applying for student visas. It wants to make sure that a student visa holder is coming to Australia for a temporary stay and for study only.The department published the latest Skilled Occupation List (SOL). An international student will get bonus points when he applies for Australian citizenship if he pursues a major related to the occupations on the list and if he manages to find a job in these professions after graduation.Some student visa applicants may suddenly shift to majors related to SOL’s occupations for their study in Australia, while they major in areas that are irrelevant to SOL’s occupations back in their motherland.These applicants must offer sound enough reasons for the change, otherwise they are very likely to be rejected.USConsultant: Qiao Xiangdong, Education International Cooperation GroupTo stay and hunt for a job in the US after graduation, international students can participate in optional practical training (OPT).They are eligible to have 12 months of OPT before getting work visas; graduates majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are given 29 months.On May 12, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement added 50 majors to the STEM-designated degree program.
