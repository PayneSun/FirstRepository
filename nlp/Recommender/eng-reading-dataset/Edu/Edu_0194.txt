How to handle internships
Jiang Zhongjie, 19, a sophomore majoring in marine biology at Xiamen University, looks at recruitment websites almost every day.As summer vacation approaches, he can’t decide which internship position would benefit him.“I think it is hard to know what would be a meaningful intern job,” he said.“Most of the time, the positions on offer are low paid, menial or trivial jobs, such as sales promotion,” said Jiang.Last month, during an education forum, Huang Guitian, assistant to the president of Peking University, called for a halt to low-end internships, lambasting them as “monotonous and meaningless, adversely affecting students’ academic performance”.Huang conducted a mini survey, showing “80 percent of students merely do odd jobs on internship”.But, employers, HRs and students may have different attitudes. According to a survey of 116 Beijing and Shanghai-based corporations by Zhaopin.com, a leading human resource services site, nearly 60 percent said they still valued applicants’ hands-on experience most.Zhang Jianhong, HR director in Huawei Technologies Co Ltd echoed this idea and believes that internship even goes beyond acquiring experience.“An internship actually offers a great chance for students to get an inside glimpse of a company, an industry and a particular occupation,” he said.He says it can help interns discover whether the career they are considering is suitable for them.And if students are aware of which industry they would like to enter, Zhang suggests that they select an internship in a relevant field, with the potential to turn into a formal job offer.Han Cong, 22, a senior majoring in international economics in Shanghai International Studies University, got a job offer from Deloitte Global Services Limited because of his excellent performance as an intern. “You need to read the internship description clearly before you apply. Make sure you are going to get what you want out of it,” he shared his tips.For students who don’t like running errands like photocopying, fetching lunch and sorting archives, employers urge them to be a bit more patient.After all, HRs think there’s still a big difference between being a student at work, and being a well-trained full-time employee. “It is understandable that some employers do not assign interns important and challenging tasks,” said Chen Nian, a marketing director in ifeng.com. “It is almost impossible for interns to learn to accomplish them during the limited internship period.”An intern has advantages not available to most full-time employees.“You can explore a wide variety of possibilities - you are not necessarily bound to one particular job,” Hao Jian, senior human resource consultant of Zhaopin.com said.“You are encouraged to talk with staff from other departments, and ask more questions than a formal employee.“In this way, you learn from a collective experience.”Hao says that interns can learn from others at any work as long as they pay attention to the environment. “The more respect you have for an internship opportunity, the more you will get out of it in the long run,” he said.
