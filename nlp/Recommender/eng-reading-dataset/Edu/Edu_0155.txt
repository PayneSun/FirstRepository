Early birds confuse job market
The junior year is a midway checkpoint for university life. Some might still be having a high time on campus, but others are thinking about something else: job hunting.Submitting resumes, visiting job fairs, even taking interviews - it seems some junior students have already joined the job-searching throng. But this has invited different views from their peers.Zhang Long, 21, a junior majoring in administration management at Sun Yat-sen University, is one of these early birds.He began to prepare his resume during last year’s summer holiday and visited several job fairs this semester. After attending three interviews he was eventually offered an internship at the Agricultural Bank of China.“If I start focusing on beefing up my resume as well as my interviewing and networking skills this year I will be better prepared than others for job hunting during the senior year,” said Zhang.Other students have thrown themselves into job-hunting early on in order to figure out their career goals.Ding Wei, 21, a junior majoring in English at Beijing Normal University, visited job fairs to explore and get a feel for the career paths she is considering.“At the fairs, I meet with HR managers to discuss my options,” she said. “Even if you’re already clear about the career you want, this can help confirm or delay your decision, or tell you more about the professional skills you will need.”But not all students welcome the presence of juniors in the job market.Mo Qiao, 22, a senior majoring in civil engineering at Tongji University, disagrees with their early engagement.“Job interviews are not mock exams to practice your skills,” Mo said. “For us, they represent rice bowls. Juniors shouldn’t crowd the market and diminish our chances.”HRs have also lodged complaints about juniors wasting their time when selecting the right person for a position. “Juniors cannot work full time, so we can hardly hire them,” said Cui Chunlan, HR manager at Siemens China Ltd.“When they hand us resumes and attend interviews, it is confusing for us and drains our energy for dealing with the large amount of applicants.”Companies allow junior students to take internships, but most require regular working hours. If internships are too demanding and reduce a student’s academic learning time, they are advised to cut down and take their studies more seriously.Zheng Zhihong, deputy director of the Employment Guidance Center at Jilin University, suggests students pay a personal visit to target companies.“If there are only a few companies on your list, you can ask seniors or grads who are working there about the working environment,” Zheng said.“Apart from seeing the office, you can also look around the neighborhood and get an idea of how affordable housing and dining are in that area,” said Zheng.Improving your job-searching skills through other channels is another recommendation. “You can prepare for interviews by yourself or with the help of classmates,” said Cui.“Or you can build up your professional network by creating a profile on social networking sites.”
