Young girl takes on adult role in spotlight
Unrelenting media attention has brought hope, and a lot of disturbance, to a 10-year-old girl struggling through a difficult life.Long Zhanghuan won widespread sympathy and media attention after a photo went online showing her carrying her 2-year-old cousin to school because she had to take care of him.Long and her 5-year-old brother — from Haoyou village in Hunan province — have been living with their grandparents since their parents divorced five years ago. Her father has custody but has not been home for three years.Throughout the week, reporters from newspapers, magazines and TV from across the country have been flocking to her school, raising questions and asking to bring the girl out of the classroom to photograph her walking the mountainous road back home, said Wu Yansheng, principal of Shanjiang Primary School."Initially I wanted more people to know about students in similar difficulties, but it quickly got too aggressive for the girl and I had to cancel further visits," he said."The girl was too young and inexperienced to deal with such enormous media exposure. She broke down in tears after repeated interviews on Oct 25," Wu said.Long’s hardship as a left-behind child is not uncommon in Shanjiang township. Children of her age often take up the role of an adult at home, doing housework and taking care of smaller siblings, according to Mo Bokun, the girl’s class teacher.Wu Xiaohui, the principle of the primary school in Haoyou village, said students sometimes bring smaller kids to keep an eye on them while at school, to ease the burden on adults during busy farming seasons.The media exposure has disrupted Long’s normal life, but also brought her unexpected help from philanthropists. However, other kids facing similar difficulties may sooner or later feel it unfair to make out Long as the only one struggling and ignore many others, Mo said.On Oct 28, a charity group based in Beijing arrived and donated 30 pairs of shoes to kids in disadvantaged households, including Long.According to the group, a philanthropist offered to donate 2,000 yuan a month for five years to Long’s family so they could hire a helper and ease the children’s burden.Long’s grandparents were grateful of the offer and thanked the widespread sympathy brought by media coverage. Her grandfather, Long Wanting, said the girl’s father learned of the news, but could not schedule time to come back and check on the children.
