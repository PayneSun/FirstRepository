Recycled shells produce fertilizer
Turning trash into treasure is a good idea. The problem is that it’s hard to do. But a group of students recently succeeded.They recycled oyster shells in a remote coastal village into a million-yuan business and won an international organization’s top award.In the summer of 2010, Han Cong, a senior majoring in marine chemistry and economics at Xiamen University, went to Dawu village in Fujian province. Smelly oyster shells piled up alongside the roads bothered him.“They smelled really bad and millions of flies were buzzing around, which was a hazard,” said Han.The 22-year-old wanted to do something about it. He did some research and found out that millions of tons of oyster shells are disposed of unprocessed in the coastal regions of the country.In many villages, they presented a major health issue.Han read an article about how oyster shells are made into fertilizer and construction materials in Japan and Taiwan.Han encouraged fellow students to contact several Taiwan factories.Han suspected that it could be a “trash to treasure fairytale”.His instinct was right.The replies from companies were positive and an oyster shell processing factory has been operating for more than a year.Fertilizer from shells is sold to northeastern China to improve the soil quality.And the average income of villagers has increased steadily as the factory develops.Their idea was praised by Amy Wang, one of the judges from Johnson & Johnson China Ltd in the 2012 SIFE China National Competition held in Beijing last week.“Those students utilized limited resources in a sustainable business model,” she said. Their creative idea has achieved long-term philanthropic goals. Their scheme is uniquely different from many other philanthropic projects featuring only donations,” said Wang。
