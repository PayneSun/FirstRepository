Perfect in speaking, learnt entirely in China
A new wave of Chinese migration is afoot, fuelled by ever-younger students for whom English is not a piece of knowledge to be learnt but a living language able to unlock the intricacies of the wider world.Shen Jiahui and Wang Taojun learnt English at school and speak it perfectly without having ever set foot outside China. So well did they learn the language, they ranked second and fourth among 10,000 entrants in a national English public speaking competition run by the English language newspaper China Daily.’’Interest is the best teacher and also the first teacher,’’ Mr Wang said. ’’For me, the second teacher would be the ambition to know the world outside of China.’’The pair, hosted this week in Australia by the competition sponsor, Navitas English, addressed the subject of cultural clashes in their final talk.Ms Shen, who hopes to undertake an MBA at an American university, said clashes were inevitable but not insurmountable.’’I came across them with my American teacher,’’ she said. ’’When we met him he said ’Why are you so quiet?’’’From that day on we tried to communicate with him and he tried to understand Chinese students and become more patient.’’We can overcome cultural clashes and pursue cultural co-existence, which is very important in the 21st century, because we are co-operating with each other in a global world.’’This year 200,000 Chinese students chose not to sit the traditional university pathway, the national college entrance exam, setting their goals instead above and beyond a domestic university place.Most will head to the US, with European universities - now offering courses in English - and Australia and Canada also competing destinations.A deputy editor with China Daily, Shen Gang, said the competition grew from Beijing’s failure to win the battle with Sydney to host the 2000 Olympics, in part because so few citizens could speak English.’’There’s no other language with the role English has had, and still does, in international communications as a working language,’’ Mr Shen said.’’English is, for most Chinese, the bridge or link between China and the outside world.’’This is why Chinese parents pay attention as well as money for the English education of their children.’’Mr Shen said English had no rival as the external language for Chinese students.It is now compulsory for students from their third year of primary school and is the language of joint ventures for companies such as Nokia, Siemens and Volkswagen.Learning it is one thing, speaking it has been another, with Chinese students typically learning ’’mute English’’, Mr Shen said. Now they are speaking up and it is vital they continue to do so, he said.’’Public speaking is a fundamental base for democracy. If you don’t speak publicly, ideas won’t be exchanged and people won’t know what others are thinking about,’’ Mr Shen said.’’That’s the basic purpose for us to promote the competition: it’s part of citizenship building.’’
