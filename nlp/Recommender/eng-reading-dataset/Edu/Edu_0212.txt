Staying fit and healthy
It’s a scenic walk on an elegant slope from the main gate of Central China Normal University to the school of Chinese literature. But Cheng Jiamin, 20, a junior, finds it so exhausting that she has to think twice before visiting the shops near the gate.A recent report says college students’ physical fitness is *lamentable. Experts warn a growing trend of staying in dorms, unhealthy diets and lack of exercise.The Chinese Health Education Center recently issued a report showing that more than 50 percent of college students lack enough exercise and 13 percent of them are *obese.“We have so many other options to keep ourselves busy, plus it’s really cold to work out outdoors,” said Cheng.Ma Guansheng is director of the Institute for Nutrition and Food Safety under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Ma reckons that students’ physical condition is *degenerating, with regard to *stamina, *agility and power.“Females students in particular are out of condition and underweight. More than 35 percent of women on campus are unhealthily slim,” Ma told Xinhua News Agency last week.“Dieting is harming their health and tends to impact their future well-being.”However, Cheng still feels guilty after eating a full meal and tries to avoid being too active so that “I don’t look sweaty and messy”.Not only female students shun sports. Some young men are reluctant to go to the playing fields.Zhang Yichang, 21, a junior at Guangzhou University, stays in his dorm almost all day. Skipping meals and staying up late is his regular lifestyle.But he is not bored: video games, online chatting, micro blogging and updating social networking sites takes up most of his time.Zhang researches and writes up assignments using his laptop.“I am not a geek,” he said.“Many students in my dorm building are like me, some even have their meals delivered to their doors,” said Zhang.Lack of exercise is likely to cause obesity and overweight which then lead to various chronic diseases, according to Kong Lingzhi, deputy director of the disease prevention and control *bureau of the Ministry of Health.She says that there are over 300 million Chinese suffering from *chronic disease and more students are likely to join them if they choose to lead an inactive campus life.“Students’ *inactivity will become a problem when those young people enter the workforce in the near future,” said Kong.
