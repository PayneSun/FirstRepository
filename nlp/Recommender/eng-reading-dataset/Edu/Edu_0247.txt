University presidents defy expectations with hit performances on campus
During a distinguished alumni memorial concert at Nanjing University on May 14, Chen Jun, president of the university, was invited by the students to sing a song on stage. Totally winging it, Chen gave in and sang a rousing rendition of "The Story of a Small Town" – with the host only needing to remind him of a few lyrics.The footage of this singular phenomenon has since caught on like wildfire on video-sharing sites popular with students.Continuing a trendZhou Wenbin, the president of Jiangxi Province’s Nanchang University, also let loose a little ditty during the university’s 90th anniversary ceremony. Unsurprisingly, the footage has also become Internet gold. In the video, Zhou and 10 other top school leaders sang a chorus from "Xinshou Qianlian", the theme song of the 2002 China National Water-Skiing Championship. The amusing incongruence between their woefully out-of-tune singing and unflinchingly dedicated facial expressions soon became a hot topic among student-netizens.Many didn’t mind that they can’t sing to save their lives – they appreciated the gall and gumption it takes to do more than simply give another speech."President Zhou was always so solemn and sedate in the past," Nanchang University junior Li Changyong said. "I think this kind of thing can only bolster their image around campus, make them a more personable face of the school overall."Though they may have caught more attention for their antics, neither Chen nor Zhou can claim to be the first university president to go from zero to hero with a song.Xu Zhihong, the former president of Peking University, won over the public in 2008 for his rendition of the popular song "Invisible Wings" during the university’s New Year party. One student who was present said that Xu’s song was by far and away the highlight of the evening.A more open universityNowadays everyone uploads videos of themselves singing onto the Internet, but it’s still a major event when someone like a university president gives it a whirl. These provide a contrast to the stereotype that the most emotion their presidents ever show is a smile and a nod at a conference or ceremony.Zheng Ruoling, an education expert at Xiamen University, said that university presidents, who have a certain administrative rank but are also busy with academic activities, have very limited opportunities for face-to-face communication with students.Zheng argues that the approachability of a president to some extent embodies how open the university is, and that more communication is needed between students and major university leaders, including the president.Strengthening communicationIn addition to singing, some presidents have taken other "fashionable" measures to strengthen their communication with students.Li Xiaohong, president of Wuhan University started personally replying to online posts of students on blogs and forums, while at Xiamen University, the president Zhu Chongshi started holding a "having breakfast with the president" activity as of late last year, which is held once every month. Every student who wants to communicate with president Zhu can apply on the Internet and then have a three-hour-long talk with him during the leisurely meal – though singing should definitely not be expected.
