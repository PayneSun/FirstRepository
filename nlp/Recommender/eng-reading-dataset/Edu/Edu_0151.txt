Benefits attract PLA recruits
For a young Chinese college student five years ago, deciding to join the military would have taken a lot of courage.But today, joining the military has become an increasingly popular choice for students. This is due to the demand for advanced talents in the military and new policies encouraging students to join the army.Zhou Chengchen, 24, a graduate student majoring in finance at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, passed the physical checkup of the conscription process early this month.“I hope to strengthen both my body and mind through intense drills. Also, I’m not worried about resuming my studies if I leave,” he said. “I regard joining the army a good career path.”Zhou is not the only student to have turned his eyes to military camps.As modern warfare and military tactics involve increasingly complex technology and maneuvers, maintaining modern troops requires well-educated talents to operate complicated equipment.According to Beijing’s conscription office, compared with 2001 – the first year Beijing began to enroll university students in the army - the ratio of university recruits has risen from 0.1 percent to 60 percent.“A bachelor’s or higher degree can help you get through the application process. Your knowledge in a particular area may prove to be invaluable,” said Song Xiepeng, deputy director of the conscription office in Beijing.For instance, according to Song, those studying languages can play a big role, as communication between the militaries of different countries is vital. Those studying telecommunications or electronics are also in demand, as both will be key areas of competition in the future.Song suggested that students join the army after they finish the second year of their university course.“It is a worthwhile experience that broadens your horizon,” said Song. “This approach allows you more time to consider your career options and whether to join the army or not.”Wang Hai, 19, a sophomore majoring in machinery electronics at Chongqing Vocational Institute of Engineering, was thrilled when the army came to his university especially to recruit students from his major.“My family supported my decision to join the army, which let my childhood dream come true,” Wang said.In order to attract high quality talents into the army, graduate recruits are put on an accelerated promotion and pay scheme.According to a policy released by the State Council and the Central Military Commission in 2009, up to 24,000 yuan of a student’s tuition fees will be reimbursed once they join the army. Furthermore, graduate students may quickly be promoted to the rank of sergeant.Students planning a military career may also receive additional benefits, such as financial assistance from local governments. For instance, in Chongqing’s Shapingba district, student recruits receive an in-service allowance of 350 yuan per month, which continues for two years after they retire from service.In Shanghai, university students can apply for a Shanghai hukou (household registration) after they leave and are given priority for civil service positions.Lai Jinliang, 29, served in the air force for seven years before being transferred to civilian work in Guangxi. “For the most part, being in the army is about learning new skills, discipline, motivation and other personal qualities through which I can improve myself,” Lai said.
