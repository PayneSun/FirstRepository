Men Compete in Global Game of Ball Control and Hot Looks
Manly features pull throughPlayers with a masculine appearance are perfect for soccer, a sport that requires lots of physical power and stamina. It makes them even sexier when their playing skills are equally mature.Iker CasillasAge: 33National team: SpainPosition: GoalkeeperHands down the best-looking goalkeeper in the world, the tall, dark and handsome Casillas has an elegant look befitting of a movie star.Casillas and his team are returning this year as defending champions. We hope his team makes it to the finals, simply because we wouldn’t know where to look if we didn’t have the Spanish team to ogle at.Gonzalo HiguainAge: 26National team: ArgentinaPosition: StrikerWith his beard, Higuain looks a bit beyond his age, just like his skills.After transferring from Real Madrid to Napoli in 2013, Higuain has become a mainstay in the attack and the team’s top scorer. Higuain was also Argentina’s top scorer at the 2010 World Cup with four goals. We look forward to seeing how he will top himself this time.Mats HummelsAge: 25National team: GermanyPosition: Central defenderWe have our eyes on Hummels, maybe because of his manly looks and charming smile. Big-name premier league teams also have their eyes on Hummels whenever transfer season starts, because he’s simply one of the best defenders out there.Considered the backbone of Germany’s defense, Hummels’ performance is the key for Germany to be the top contender in the 2014 World Cup.Uniqueness is attractiveSoccer isn’t a beauty pageant, so players who don’t have a traditionally handsome face certainly have an equal chance to shine, as long as they offer fans something to remember, no matter if it’s skills, personality, or even an edgy style.Neymar JuniorAge: 22National team: BrazilPosition: ForwardAt such a young age, Neymar is a proven goal scorer who has attracted interest from top clubs such as Barcelona, Chelsea and Real Madrid.Known for his speed, dribbling and ability with both feet, Neymar’s playing style has earned him critical acclaim.There’s no doubt he will grow up to be quite an attractive man, as promised by his sharp looks and dreamy eyes. Brazil’s hopes are high for this young star to lead the team to glory. We just hope he gets a better haircut soon.Mario BalotelliAge: 23National team: ItalyPosition: StrikerIn a recent interview with The Independent, the AC Milan striker declared himself “the coolest, funniest and best-looking player in the Italy squad that is current(ly) readying for the World Cup”.Maybe he gets it from his unique looks — Balotelli has a reputation for an explosive temper and superb stamina. One spark from him can change the course of a game, or even the whole tournament. We certainly hope to see how Balotelli will tear up the World Cup in Brazil.
