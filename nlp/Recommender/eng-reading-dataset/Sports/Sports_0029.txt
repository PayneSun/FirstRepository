Men Compete in Global Game of Ball Control and Hot Looks
Let’s face it: half the fun of watching the World Cup is the eye candy.Soccer is a sport with the most striking and attractive players worldwide. Soccer fans not only love watching the sport as a game, they are also fascinated by the handsome players. Even if you’re not a soccer expert, who could say no to watching players work up a sweat on the pitch while showing off their incredible bodies?Two weeks ago, we conducted a poll on 21st Century’s WeChat account in which we asked readers to pick their favorite type of soccer player. Here are the top choices according to the results, and maybe a few more reasons to watch the world’s biggest soccer event.Winning personalityThe players in this category may not have the most gorgeous faces or excellent bodies, but their sincere temperament and accessible personality make them even more attractive. So it makes perfect sense that they ended up being our readers’ favorite type.Lionel MessiAge: 26National team: ArgentinaPosition: ForwardAlthough the Argentine superstar has had a relatively disappointing year on the field, you can’t change the fact that he’s a witty yet handsome player, with a strong personality.This year’s World Cup in Brazil is Messi’s chance to make a mark on soccer’s greatest stage and prove himself to those who still have doubts about his ability. Even if Argentina doesn’t make it all the way, watching Messi weave through his opponents promises to be one of the highlights of the World Cup.OscarAge: 22National team: BrazilPosition: MidfielderKaka didn’t make it onto Brazil’s national team, but there’s another baby-faced player in the lineup: Oscar, who even shares a similar playing style and ability with Kaka.At only 22, Oscar is already a mature attacking wizard. A superb dribbler, Oscar is fluid and creative in his runs. As a playmaker, Oscar has great vision and is able to deliver precise passes to his teammates. Crucial to the side’s balance, the Chelsea star may well hold the key to Brazil’s attempts to seize glory.Mario GotzeAge: 22National team: GermanyPosition: MidfielderGotze’s warm smile may be charming and attractive, but that doesn’t mean a soft playing style on the field.The German player is known for his ruthless attempts on the goal, high speed, excellent technical and dribbling skills, and playmaking capabilities. The German Football Association’s former technical director Matthias Sammer describes Gotze as “one of the best talents that [Germany’s] ever had”.After a respectable performance at Bayern Munich, this year’s World Cup will be the measure of how high Gotze rises in our estimation.Appearances countThanks to David Beckham, who has successfully become a fashion icon, more players are paying attention to their personal style – and a distinct hairstyle is the easiest thing to begin with, especially while on the pitch. Of course, a beautiful face is a must.Cristiano RonaldoAge: 29National team: PortugalPosition: ForwardYou can’t have a “hottest players” list without Cristiano Rondaldo in it. Anyone who has watched his games and commercials knows that he is probably the perfect human being, in terms of physique and athletic ability.Ronaldo is the most expensive soccer player in history and it looks like he’s worth every cent. The 29-year-old will lead Portugal’s World Cup 2014 team as captain, despite suffering from a hamstring injury. And there’s no need to explain why he’s hot – his latest cover for Vogue Spain says it all.Sergio AgueroAge: 26National team: ArgentinaPosition: StrikerThe speedy and powerful Aguero made his debut in the Argentine league in 2003, when he was only 15. Since then, he has won Olympic gold with Argentina in 2008, the Europa League with Atletico Madrid in 2010, and the Premier League in his first season with Manchester City in 2012.It will be exiting to see how Aguero does in this World Cup, because if you have watched him play, you will know how good he is — and how his dark brown hair is elaborately brushed.
