Fourth-time honor
A Champions League victory with Real Madrid and European Championship glory with Portugal has led to Cristiano Ronaldo being gifted his fourth Ballon d’Or.The *prolific Portuguese player had previously won soccer’s ultimate individual honor in 2008, 2013 and 2014. But Ronaldo, famous for his *chiseled *physique, too-good-to-be-true tan and *penchant for fast cars, has arguably had his best year yet.He beat off competition from the likes of five-time Ballon winner Lionel Messi and French ace Antoine Griezmann, who finished second and third in the vote respectively. While both of those men had standout seasons for both club and country, their lack of international silverware counted against them when it came to determining the best in the world this year. Impressively, Ronaldo and Messi have now won the past nine Ballon d’Or awards between them.The victor was unable to attend the Dec 12 awards ceremony in Paris as Real Madrid had traveled to Japan to take part in the FIFA Club World Cup.“For me, it’s an unbelievable moment – I’m so proud, so happy,” he told the audience on the big screen in a pre-recorded interview. “Thank you to everyone who voted for me. Thank you to my teammates, Portugal national team, and this trophy is for Real Madrid.”Ronaldo was tipped to win the award after a *stellar year, but Messi had also been in superb form, helping Barcelona win La Liga last season as well as scoring 50 goals in 50 games in 2016. Messi also played in the Copa America for Argentina in the summer, scoring five goals, but missed a penalty in the final as Chile won the shootout 4-2.The confident Portuguese native has scored 38 goals and added 14 assists in 2016. He has the third-best minutes-per-goal ratio of anyone in the top five European Leagues.“It is not easy,” he told L’Equipe TV of gaining his latest *accolade. “You can count those who are capable of playing at the highest level year after year on the fingers of one hand. I am among them. There are very few.”The Ballon d’Or is decided by votes from 173 sports journalists from around the world.It’s been awarded by esteemed magazine France Football every year since 1956, but for the past six years it became the FIFA Ballon d’Or, working in association with international soccer’s governing body.However, FIFA ended its association with the award in September and handed full association of the honor back to the magazine this year.FIFA will hand out its own prize for the world’s best men’s player, along with the best women’s player and team of the year, at the Best FIFA Football Awards ceremony in Zurich on Jan 9.
