Michael Phelps admits: we do pee in the pool
Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, has revealed what no sports fan wants to hear – that Olympic swimmers occasionally relieve themselves in the pool.The US swimmer said: “I think everybody pees in the pool. It’s kind of a normal thing to do for swimmers. When we’re in the water for two hours, we don’t really get out to pee.“Chlorine kills it so it’s not bad.”Phelps was responding to comments made by fellow swimmer Ryan Lochte, who caused controversy recently when he reportedly said that he has on occasion relieved himself while in the pool.Lochte has revealed that he peed in the pool while warming up for the London Olympics.The 28-year-old swimming star made the revelation when radio personality Ryan Seacrest asked him, if swimmers urinate in the pool."Of course. We always do," he said"I think there’s just something about getting into chlorine water that you just automatically go," he added.When asked if he did that during the London Olympics, he said: "Not during the races, but I sure did before in warm-up."His battle with Phelps was one of the big talking points of the Games.Lochte won the 400 metres individual medley, with Phelps finishing fourth.But Phelps got his revenge in the 200 metres event, winning the race, as Lochte finished in the silver medal position.The two were part of the US team that won gold in the 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay.
