The result was not quite up to my expectation, but in the end I won the title," said Xu."I felt a little tired in the final part of the race, and did not feel as smooth as in the semifinals, because it had much impact on the podium position," he added.Xu finished 51.86 seconds in National Championships in April, just one hundredth second shy of the world record set by Ryan Murphy of the United States last year in Rio. Olympic champion Murphy got the bronze medal at 52.59 seconds."I performed quite well in the semifinals, so it was normal for me to have some ideas in my mind.
