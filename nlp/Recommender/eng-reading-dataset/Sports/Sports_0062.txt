The hot favorites to win this year are Brazil, Spain, Argentina -- and your boyfriend’s team.  5. Please don’t say,” What’s going on, a dozen people are rushing to and fro chasing a ball?”during the match, your boyfriend might get angry.   6. Next month, your boyfriend will only have room in his memory for the competition schedule and teams. So don’t bother him with anything else, for example, whether he remembers why a particular day in June is so important. Keep it quiet, even if it is your anniversary. What do you say if he answers,“10 o’clock, Brazil VS Netherlands”? 7. Get used to not being treated so well next month. Remember, it’s only once in every four years. Forgive him!8.
