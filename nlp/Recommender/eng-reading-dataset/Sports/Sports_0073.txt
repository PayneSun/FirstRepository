Federer makes Grand Slam history
A year ago, Roger Federer left Centre Court a broken man after losing an epic five-set final, his Wimbledon title ripped away and his aura of invincibility shattered. On Sunday, after another five-set marathon, Federer walked off  with the winner’s trophy and No. 1 ranking back in his grasp and his reputation enhanced as arguably the greatest player of all time.Federer won his record 15th Grand Slam title, outlasting Andy Roddick for his sixth Wimbledon championship.Federer overcame the resilient American 5-7, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5), 3-6, 16-14 to break the record of major titles he shared with Pete Sampras."I’m happy I broke the record here because this is always the tournament that meant the most to me," Federer said. Federer jumped high in celebration, punched the air and whacked the net with his racket. Roddick tossed his racket to the side and the two men shared a hug at the net. Federer held up the trophy, kissed it and held it close to his chest.Watching from the front row of the Royal Box was Sampras, a seven-time Wimbledon champion who flew in from California to see history made in his first appearance at the All England Club since playing here for the last time in 2002. Also on hand were Bjorn Borg and Rod Laver.Turning to Sampras, Federer said: "Thanks very much for coming. I know it’s a long way, but you’re a member, man, we like to see you here. It’s such a pleasure to play in front of such greats legends.""In a way I still feel like we share (the record) because he was such a wonderful champion," Federer said of Sampras. " It’s nice that he shows appreciation for what I’m doing."Roddick said: "Sorry Pete, I tried to hold him off."
