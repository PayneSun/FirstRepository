Boos throughout the ages
It was during the men’s 100m final on Aug 14 that US *sprinter Justin Gatlin, after stepping out into the stadium ready to race, was met by a song of cheers which quickly *cascaded into a chorus of *boos.The crowds at Rio evidently still haven’t forgiven Gatlin for his historical doping bans, but the US runner hasn’t been the only one subjected to the *wrath of the Brazilian booers at the 2016 Olympics.Earlier in the month, Egyptian Judoka Islam El Shehaby was also unceremoniously booed for refusing to shake hands with opponent Or Sasson after being defeated by the Israeli.It seems that audience members at the 2016 Rio Olympics have been roundly criticized for their over-zealous jeering, which seems to be more commonplace than at previous Games, suggesting that the crowds in Brazil are perhaps a more “sprightly bunch” than in previous years.But although booing is not a staple of the Olympic crowd’s etiquette, it is by no means a recent phenomenon.The first written record of mass *heckling comes from, of course, ancient Greece, according to website The BOO Birds.It says that during *gladiator fights, booing or cheering literally meant life or death to the *combatants–the crowds would cheer to keep you alive or boo to have you put out of your misery.The word “boo” didn’t make its written appearance until the 1800s however, where it was used to describe the sound that cattle make. It wasn’t until later that century that its use to describe the noise our friends in modern day Brazil enjoy making came into existence.Reasons for booing vary a lot throughout Olympic history. Some are merely trivial matters – according to a Time news report, at the 1936 Bavaria Winter Olympics, Italian hockey players “loudly booed *pugnacious US player Gordon Smith”, who accused an Italian player of knocking his glasses off – while others are more political.At the 1973 Munich Olympics, the gold and silver medals for the men’s 400m dash were awarded to US runners Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collett – both African-Americans.When the US national *anthem was played during the medal ceremony, they refused to face the flag and stood casually with their hands on their hips, instead of one hand on their chests, as tradition would dictate.Although their intention was to draw attention to the poor treatment of African-Americans in their country at the time, this backfired and their *unbridled behavior drew loud boos from the crowd. “The IOC called it a ‘disgusting display’ and barred them,” wrote The New York Times.Furthermore, during the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Zola Budd, a South African-born British athlete, faced a barrage of boos from the audience of the women’s 3,000m final, after getting tangled up with US runner Mary Decker who then came crashing to the ground.But the underlying cause for the booing wasn’t her clumsiness – Budd had only applied for British citizenship earlier that year, since South Africa at the time was banned from participating in the Olympics due to its then-policy of *apartheid.“The switch was hugely controversial during the apartheid-era sporting boycott,” wrote The Guardian.Despite the fact that booing to express displeasure during the Olympic Games is far from elegant, it seems that it’s been a feature of the games long before Brazil. Just as Time notes, “its presence by now shouldn’t be shocking.”
