A look at the 2016 Rio Games
Invincible BoltOnce again, Jamaica’s Usain Bolt, 29, has proven that he’s *indisputably the fastest man in the world.On Aug 15 (Beijing time), Bolt finished the men’s 100m dash in just 9.81 seconds, taking the gold in this event for an *unprecedented third consecutive time.It all followed Bolt’s *customary routine: a *languorous start followed by a strong *acceleration to make his rivals desperate, topped off with his signature lightning-bolt celebratory pose.He made it look so easy. In the semifinal, Bolt even turned his head to watch his competitors with a toothy smile as he breezed past them before he reached the finish line.Taking home a gold medal at the Olympics is already a huge achievement, but one gold would be considered a failure by Bolt who now has seven to his name.“I came here to win three gold medals, I came here to prove myself as one of the greats,” Bolt said after the 100m win.“If by any chance it doesn’t happen, I’m going to feel sad because I didn’t do what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted to set myself apart from everybody else and this is the Olympics, I have to do it.”The sprinter’s next goal is to replicate his success in the 200 meters and 4x100 meters on Aug 19 and 20.The legend continuesWe are lucky enough to live in a generation to witness some true legends: Usain Bolt, the fastest man on the ground, and Michael Phelps, the fastest man in water.On Aug 14, the *phenomenal Phelps finished his fourth Olympics with five golds. He’s the most decorated athlete of all time, even before coming to Rio, and now has 23 gold Olympic medals in his collection.Despite this, the 31-year-old has *reiterated his intention to retire. “Done, done, done. This time I mean it,” he claimed on The Today Show on Aug 15. “I wanted to come back and finish my career how I wanted. And this was the cherry on top of the cake that I wanted.”He previously announced that he was to quit after the London 2012 Games, but this time, he seems to be more determined than ever. He has nothing to prove in the pool and he has a new challenge in life – to be a good father. After he won the men’s 200m butterfly on Aug 9, the first thing Phelps did was to *embrace his family and kiss his 3-month-old son.Nevertheless, Team USA will continue their dominance with a new leader, Katie Ledecky. The 19-year-old genius with five Olympic golds has swum in 15 individual races in a major international final and won all of them, according to ESPN.Love in the airOn Aug 15, Chinese diver He Zi, 25, won big at the women’s 3m *springboard event – not just a silver, but also a diamond.As He stepped down from the *podium after the awards ceremony, Qin Kai, 30, her boyfriend and teammate, surprised crowds, rushing toward her with a diamond ring and a red rose *encased in glass. Under the gaze of diving fans in Rio and Olympics viewers across the world, Qin bent on one knee and popped the question. Silver medalist He responded with a tearful nod as the crowds applauded.China’s gold medalist Shi Tingmao and third-placed Tania Cagnotto of Italy held each other’s shoulders and watched on with big smiles on their faces.“We’ve been together for almost six years. He made many promises to me (during the proposal), but what touched me the most was that he said he was willing to be *bullied by me throughout his life,” He said later at a press conference.Four years ago in London, He gave Qin a hug at the poolside when he shed tears for losing the gold medal at men’s, afterward assuring the public that they were just teammates in order to protect their careers and relationship.Dream teamTwo Chinese national flags were raised *simultaneously at the awards ceremonies for the women’s and men’s table tennis final on Aug 11 and 12. Ding Ning, 26, beat teammate Li Xiaoxia, 28, and Ma Long, 27, won over Zhang Jike, 28, to claim the gold *respectively.But if there weren’t rules in place which only allow each country to enter two athletes per event, China would probably have had three flags flying that day.According to statistics from Quartz, “nobody dominates a sport quite like China does table tennis”. The Chinese table-tennis team has the highest percentage of gold wins at 85.7 percent while the US basketball team 78.6 percent.The women’s team did exceptionally well – winning every single medal going.Some foreign media say that other countries may lose interest in this sport as Chinese players are too powerful to beat. Well, Chinese players do train hard to reach the top.“It’s not the fault of the Chinese players that they are so good. So my opinion is that the others have to work very hard,” International Table Tennis Federation President Thomas Weikert said at a press conference in Rio.
