Olympic rings fail is already on a T-shirt
This is probably one of the more unique Sochi 2014 souvenirs you can get your hands on.Sochi 2014’s opening ceremony will be remembered for its spectacle and beautiful presentation of Russian culture, but most of all (let’s face it) for the glitch during the show’s opening moments.Five giant snowflakes were suspended above the Fisht Stadium, which were then meant to open out, flower-like, into the five Olympic rings.Unfortunately, the fifth ring failed to open, leading to many a quickly-produced Vine video and numerous witty puns on Twitter.This T-shirt will let you – and everyone you point it out to – relive the moment for years to come.An image of the snowflake feature from the opening ceremony, complete with the malfunctioning snowflake still closed, is shown on the T-shirt. A caption next to the item reads: ‘When one snowflake doesn’t open…an opportunity does.’
