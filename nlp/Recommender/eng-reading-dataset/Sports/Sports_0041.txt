Is the Prime Minster jinxing our Olympic Medal hopefuls?
When Bradley Wiggins goes for gold tomorrow afternoon in the men’s cycling time trial the Tour de France champion could be forgiven for checking the crowd nervously for the face of the prime minister, who is starting to get a reputation as a bit of a jinx.So far both Wiggins’ cycling colleague Mark Cavendish and Olympic poster boy Tom Daley have been denied medals by what has been dubbed the "Curse of Cameron".The prime minister was present at the trackside when Cavendish failed to win Team GB’s first Gold of the Games as expected.And he was in the stands when Daley and his partner Peter Waterfield came an agonising fourth in the synchronized diving.The curse is not restricted to the Olympics. A few weeks ago Cameron was at Wimbledon to see Andy Murray let slip a lead against Roger Federer in the tennis.Fortunately for Britain’s male gymnasts however the prime minister stayed away from the North Greenwich Arena last night where they won the country’s first medal in the event for 100 years.Although suspicions were raised that Cameron had peeked his head round the door after the team’s medal was downgraded from silver to bronze.Nerves may also be frayed in the Team GB beach volleyball camp, as the event is taking place in Horse Guards Parade next door to Cameron’s Downing Street home.Yesterday, when asked, No.10 admitted that Cameron probably "had a peek" at the event.The British hopefuls must be crossing their fingers that the curtains are drawn during their matches.
